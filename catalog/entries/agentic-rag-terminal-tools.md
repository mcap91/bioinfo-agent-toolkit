## What it says

Research demonstrates that LLM agents with direct terminal tool access (grep, find, head, cat) outperform embedding-based retrieval systems. Formalized as Direct Corpus Interaction (DCI) — agents search raw text directly using general-purpose terminal tools instead of traditional embedding pipelines. Results across multiple benchmarks:

- BrowseComp-Plus: 80% (agent + terminal tools) vs 69% (best retriever)
- Multi-hop QA: 83% vs 52%
- IR ranking: 68.5 vs 47 nDCG
- Amazon Science (AAAI 2026): agentic keyword search at 94.5% of RAG faithfulness with zero vector store

Key mechanism: an LLM driving grep iteratively can refine queries, follow imports, look at adjacent files, and self-correct. A single embedding lookup cannot. Agent-driven search reflects current file state with no index lag.

Industry adoption: Anthropic removed vector search from Claude Code in May 2025, replacing it with grep — "outperformed everything. By a lot" (Boris Cherny, Claude Code creator). Windsurf, Cline, Devin, and Sourcegraph Amp followed.

## Key takeaways

- Direct corpus access via terminal tools can outperform sophisticated embedding/vector retrieval pipelines
- Model capability matters less than retrieval interface — cheap models with right tools beat expensive models with wrong retrieval
- No offline indexing required — agent iterates: search → read → refine query → search again
- Performance depends on the agent harness, not just the retrieval method (PwC "Is Grep All You Need?" finding)
- Enterprise caveats remain: grep alone lacks access control, provenance, versioning, schema, and governance that graph-based approaches provide

## Mechanical details

The agent receives terminal tool access and corpus location. It formulates search strategies using grep, find, head, and cat to locate and read relevant passages. No pre-processing, embedding generation, or index building. The agent iterates autonomously.

DCI substantially outperforms semantic and sparse retrieval baselines across BRIGHT, BEIR, and multi-hop QA benchmarks.

## Security

Research pattern — no deployable code to audit. Giving agents terminal tool access to a corpus has its own security implications (path traversal, resource exhaustion from recursive searches, information disclosure beyond intended scope).
