## What it does

Mapgen4 generates procedural wilderness maps in the browser with real-time terrain regeneration as you paint. Built on a Delaunay+Voronoi mesh supporting 25K+ cells (up to 1M+), with detailed river networks.

Features: elevation via distance fields, rainfall/biomes/evaporation/wind simulation, oblique projection rendering (not standard rotate+translate+scale), outline rendering.

Continuation of mapgen2 ideas (2010) at larger scale. Designed to look pretty rather than generate realistic terrain. Extensive blog post series documenting the algorithms.

## Mechanical details

Install: `npm install -g esbuild && npm install && ./build.sh`. Serve: `python3 -m http.server 8000`, visit `localhost:8000/embed.html`.

TypeScript with esbuild (no type checking in build — IDE only). Uses Delaunator (MapBox), fast-2d-poisson-disk-sampling, simplex-noise, flatqueue, gl-matrix.
