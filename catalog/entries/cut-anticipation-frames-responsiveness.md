summary: Game-dev technique for making player-controlled actions feel responsive by removing, rather than speeding up, the anticipation phase of an animation. Traditional animation splits an action into three roughly equal parts — anticipation (wind-up), action, and follow-through — but the anticipation portion delays the visible response to player input. Cites classic platformers (e.g. Super Mario), where the character begins moving upward immediately on jump input instead of crouching first, and Diablo 3's early development, where a barbarian's two-handed weapon swing originally reached back from a neutral pose before striking; speeding up that wind-up still read as sluggish and lost its sense of weight, while cutting the roughly 5–6 frames (about 180ms) of anticipation entirely — so the character instantly snaps to the fully wound-up pose the instant the player clicks — fixed the responsiveness complaints. Frames the fix in terms of silhouette — an instant, dramatic change in the character's on-screen shape gives the player an immediate visual read that the input registered, substituting for the anticipation frames as the feedback signal.

## What it does

Argues that the "anticipation" phase of the classic three-part animation structure (anticipation, action, follow-through) is a direct liability for player-controlled actions, because it delays the point at which the screen visibly reacts to input — and that the fix is to cut those frames outright rather than play them faster. Two examples are given: (1) classic platformers like Super Mario have the character begin moving upward the instant the jump button is pressed, skipping a crouch/wind-up, which the reel frames as a widely-taught game-design-school principle; (2) Diablo 3's barbarian two-handed weapon swing, which during early development reached back from a neutral pose (the anticipation) before striking — play-testers called the attack sluggish, and the team's first attempt to fix it (speeding up the wind-up animation) made the swing look less believable and lose its sense of weight without actually resolving the responsiveness complaints. The fix that worked was removing the anticipation frames entirely: the moment the player clicks, the barbarian instantly snaps to the fully retracted swing-starting pose with no transition. The reel frames the mechanism via a character's "silhouette" (overall on-screen shape) — an instant, large silhouette change gives the player an immediate, satisfying visual read that their input registered, which stands in for the feedback that the anticipation frames would otherwise have provided. The removed anticipation is characterized as only about 5–6 frames, roughly 180 milliseconds, but is credited with resolving the perceived-responsiveness complaints. The reel frames this as a deliberate exception to traditional animation rules, applicable to games that prioritize input responsiveness over per-action weight — contrasted with non-interactive media (film/TV) and games where the wind-up is itself part of the gameplay (e.g. a telegraphed enemy attack), where anticipation remains appropriate.

Related but distinct from the catalog's `disney-animation-principles-game-vfx` entry, which covers *adding* anticipation (among other principles) to a non-player-controlled VFX effect for perceived weight — the opposite trade-off from this entry's player-input case.
