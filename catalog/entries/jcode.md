## What it does

A Rust-based coding agent harness (Claude Code / Codex alternative) optimized for performance and multi-session workflows. Key differentiators: 14ms time-to-first-frame (245x faster than Claude Code), 28MB RAM baseline (14x less than Claude Code), ~10MB per additional session (vs 213MB for Claude Code). Supports 30+ providers via OAuth and API key flows (Claude, OpenAI, Copilot, Gemini, Azure, OpenRouter, Ollama, LM Studio, and many more).

Notable features: Swarm mode (multiple agents in the same repo with automatic conflict detection and messaging), semantic memory system (embeds turns as vectors, retrieves related memories via cosine similarity, ambient consolidation), browser automation (Firefox Agent Bridge), self-dev mode (agent modifies its own source, builds, tests, and hot-reloads), side panels with inline Mermaid rendering, session resume from other harnesses (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Pi), adaptive agent grep (adds file structure info to grep results), and interleaved input (sends while agent works without breaking KV cache).

## Assessment

The performance numbers are legitimate and impressive — if running many concurrent sessions, jcode's ~10MB per session vs Claude Code's ~213MB is a 20x difference at scale. The swarm feature (automatic file-edit conflict detection between agents) solves a real problem for multi-agent repo work. The memory system with ambient consolidation is more sophisticated than most harness-level memory. However, watch rather than pilot because: (1) we're invested in the Claude Code ecosystem with plugins, hooks, and skills, (2) the self-dev mode where the agent modifies its own source code is a security concern, (3) no clear license file identified, and (4) the project is ambitious enough that stability/maturity questions apply. Worth monitoring for the swarm patterns and memory architecture ideas.

## Mechanical details

- Install: `curl | bash`, Homebrew, PowerShell, or from source (`cargo build --release`)
- 30+ provider integrations via `jcode login --provider <name>`
- Multi-account switching for token quota management
- Swarm: spawn multiple agents in same repo, automatic conflict notification and messaging (DM, broadcast, repo-scoped)
- Memory: semantic embedding per turn, cosine similarity retrieval, ambient consolidation, explicit memory tools
- Browser: Firefox Agent Bridge with 16+ actions (click, type, screenshot, eval, etc.)
- Self-dev mode: agent edits its own source, builds, tests, reloads binary
- Side panels for file viewing, diffs, and Mermaid diagrams (custom 1800x faster Mermaid renderer)
- Session resume from Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and Pi sessions
- Agent grep: adds file structure info to grep results for better inference
- MCP support: `~/.jcode/mcp.json` (global), `.jcode/mcp.json` (project), fallback to `.claude/mcp.json`
- Platforms: Linux x86_64/aarch64, macOS (Apple Silicon + Intel), Windows (native + WSL2), Termux
- iOS app planned with Tailscale remote access

## Security

- **License**: No LICENSE file identified from README; license status unclear
- **Dependency health**: Rust workspace; cargo dependencies. Custom Mermaid renderer and terminal (handterm) are separate repos
- **Code quality signals**: Comprehensive documentation; performance benchmarks with methodology; multiple architecture docs; safety system documented
- **Supply chain**: Single developer (1jehuang); install via `curl | bash` and PowerShell `irm | iex` — standard but requires trust
- **Dangerous patterns**: Self-dev mode allows the agent to modify its own source code and hot-reload — powerful but high-risk if the agent makes breaking changes. The README recommends frontier models for self-dev to avoid subtle bugs. Browser `eval` action is available. OAuth credential handling across 30+ providers creates a broad trust surface. Imports credentials from `~/.claude/.credentials.json` and other harness auth files
- **Maintenance**: Very active development; ambitious feature set; single developer means bus factor of 1
