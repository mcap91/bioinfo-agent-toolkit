summary: Game-dev technique/philosophy for AI-accelerated development — rather than integrating generative mesh-generation tools (e.g. Meshy), 3D-editing-software MCP integrations (e.g. a Blender MCP server), prebuilt game engines, or narrow pre-written markdown "skills," have a coding agent write custom procedural-generation code directly, encoding visual style and geometry in math/code so the same deterministic logic regenerates consistent results across every object instead of re-running a generative model per asset; animation is produced the same way, via deterministic algorithms rather than pre-made or model-generated clips; reported tradeoff is that procedural logic can fail in ways generative output does not (a demonstrated prototype had a spider whose procedurally generated legs ended up inverted), and the achievable art style is constrained relative to what a generative model could produce.

## What it does

A technique/philosophy for AI-accelerated ("vibe-coded") game development: instead of wiring up third-party generative-AI asset tools (e.g. Meshy for mesh generation), 3D-editing-software MCP integrations (e.g. a Blender MCP server), prebuilt game engines, or narrow pre-written "skills" (markdown instruction packages), direct a coding agent to write custom procedural-generation code for geometry, materials, and animation. Visual style and geometry are encoded directly in math/code — e.g. a parametric algorithm for a creature's leg structure — rather than regenerated per-object by a generative model. The claimed benefit is consistency and control: the same deterministic code produces visually coherent results across every generated instance, instead of each generative-model call introducing its own style drift. Animation is produced the same way, via deterministic algorithms, rather than pre-made clips or model-generated motion.

The reported tradeoff is reliability of a different kind: procedural logic can fail in ways generative output typically does not. A demonstrated work-in-progress prototype had a spider whose procedurally generated legs ended up inverted/glitched, a bug in the generation code rather than a quality issue in a model's output. The approach also constrains achievable art styles compared to what a generative model could attempt, trading style flexibility for consistency and debuggability. The technique was demonstrated via a prototype built with an AI coding agent (the creator names Claude Code as their preferred harness).
