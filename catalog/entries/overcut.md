## What it does

Overcut is a commercial platform for orchestrating AI coding agents across the software development lifecycle. Rather than replacing individual agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot), it adds a coordination layer above them — handling multi-agent workflows, governance, approvals, audit trails, and integration with engineering systems (Jira, Linear, GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps, Bitbucket).

Key capabilities:
- Pre-built agents and drag-and-drop workflow builder for SDLC automation
- Continuous monitoring of tickets and PRs across platforms to build organizational context
- Ephemeral sandboxed agent execution with scoped tokens and audit logs
- Deploy managed-cloud or fully on-prem (code never leaves the environment)
- Direct interaction via `@overcut` mentions on tickets and PRs

The source content is a founder discussion post articulating the thesis: the industry is converging on the need for an orchestration/governance layer above coding agents, analogous to how Git, CI/CD, and observability standardized earlier.

## Assessment
**Watch.** The problem Overcut addresses — coordinating multiple AI agents across real engineering workflows — is genuine and increasingly relevant as agent adoption scales. However:

- **Closed-source commercial product** with no public SDK, API, or self-hostable open-source component
- **Early-stage startup** — limited public track record, no independent reviews or case studies found
- **Not individually usable** — it's an enterprise platform, not a tool you integrate into a personal agent toolkit
- The broader "agentic SDLC" category is rapidly forming (GitLab+TCS, Augment Code, and others are converging on similar concepts), so the landscape may shift significantly

Worth revisiting if they release an open API, MCP integration, or self-hostable tier.

## Mechanical details

No direct integration path for individual use. The platform operates at the organizational level, sitting between ticketing systems, Git hosts, and AI coding agents. The drag-and-drop workflow builder and pre-built agents suggest low-code configuration rather than programmatic extensibility.

For this toolkit's purposes, the conceptual model is more relevant than the product: the idea that agent orchestration, governance, and coordination form a distinct infrastructure layer is worth tracking as it informs how we structure multi-agent workflows locally.

## Security

- **License:** Proprietary — no open-source license; commercial terms apply
- **Code access:** Closed-source; no public repository to audit
- **Data handling:** Claims code never leaves the customer environment (on-prem option); ephemeral sandboxes with scoped tokens
- **Audit:** Built-in audit logs claimed but not independently verified
- **Supply chain:** Cannot assess dependencies, contributor base, or code quality — closed source
- **security_flags:** `[closed-source]` — no code audit possible; all security claims are vendor-asserted
