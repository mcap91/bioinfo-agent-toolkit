summary: Practitioner philosophy arguing that production AI agents succeed with one deeply-connected surface (typically inbox+calendar via MCP) rather than broad multi-tool architectures; narrow-and-deep beats wide-and-shallow for auditability and sustained use

## What it is

A practitioner essay (with community discussion) arguing against the common pattern of wiring AI agents into many tools before validating one. Based on 30+ agent builds for founders and small teams.

## Core argument

The failure mode is not the model — it is surface area. Every tool connection is a place the agent can be confidently wrong and a place that must be audited. The value is not in connection count but in whether the one connection in use sees real, live context (via MCP) rather than stale snapshots.

## Observed pattern

Builders architect for the agent they imagine using in a year instead of the one they would trust this week. They connect 8–12 tools on day one. Something goes subtly wrong. They cannot determine which integration fed the bad context. They turn the whole system off.

## Three case studies

1. **Solo founder, B2B.** One MCP connection (mail + calendar) for reply drafting with prior thread and availability. Used daily. Planned CRM sync was never missed.
2. **Agency owner.** Mail thread + calendar over MCP for scheduling proposals. Eliminated an hour/day of calendar tetris. Multi-tool mega-agent was abandoned.
3. **Two-person startup.** Pre-meeting prep: who is this, what did we last say, what's on the calendar — assembled in one place. One read path, zero autonomy. The feature they refuse to give up.

## Decision framework for adding connections

- Is this reading the real, live source, or a stale copy? Live MCP context beats cached integrations.
- Can you audit which connection produced a given output? If not, you can only turn it off.
- Does this tool earn its place, or is it there because it demos well?
- Would you trust it to act here without you? If no, wire it as read-only feeding a draft.

## Community additions

- Start with read-only tools only; no write access until outputs are "boring-predictable" for two weeks. Write access is what makes a wrong call expensive.
- Accurate logging / auditable data streams help diagnose multi-source issues.

## Security

No installable artifact. Philosophy/architecture guidance only. The core security insight is operational: each additional integration expands the attack surface and makes auditability harder. Read-only connections before write access is the recommended progression.
