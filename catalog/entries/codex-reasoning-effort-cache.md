## What it does

Workaround for Codex CLI prompt cache invalidation when switching GPT-6 Astra reasoning effort levels.

**Problem:** Changing reasoning effort on a Codex session changes the request parameters, invalidating the prompt cache. On a low → medium switch: only 55.8% cache hit (12,160/21,791 tokens).

**Fix:** Enable `reasoning_effort_override` flag. Codex keeps the request-level effort fixed and instead adds a trusted `configuration_update` to the conversation. Result: 98.9% cache hit (21,504/21,743 tokens). Switching back: 99.3% cached.

**Usage:**
```
codex --enable reasoning_effort_override -m gpt-6-astra   # one session
codex features enable reasoning_effort_override            # persistent
```

**Caveats:** Marked "under development"; tested on bundled 0.155.0-alpha.2.6. Newer builds also check a model-capability flag. Astra-only as of Sep 2026. Fully quit and reopen the Mac app after enabling.

Discussion source: r/codex (Sep 2026). GitHub issue #42996 was the discovery vector.

## Assessment

Niche but high-value for heavy Codex users switching effort levels mid-session. The underlying technique (conversation-level config injection instead of request-level parameter changes) is a general pattern worth noting for any system with prefix caching.
