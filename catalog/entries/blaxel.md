## What it does

Blaxel provides cloud infrastructure purpose-built for autonomous agents, going beyond ephemeral sandboxes to offer persistent, stateful compute environments. Key primitives:

**Compute:**
- **Sandboxes**: One microVM per agent/app/job, boot in milliseconds, resume from standby in ~25ms with full memory state
- **Batch jobs**: Spawn thousands of tasks across individual sandboxes
- **MCP servers**: Run MCP servers as first-class workloads on Blaxel's private network
- **Agent runtime** (coming soon): Session-first stateful runtime for long-running agents

**Storage:**
- **Agent Drive**: Distributed filesystem for real-time multi-agent collaboration
- **Persistent file systems**: Survive restarts, resumes, and redeploys
- **Volumes**: Durable mounts with years-long retention
- **Sandbox local filesystem**: In-memory performance with snapshots

**Networking:**
- **Outbound control**: Allow-list egress per workload with true firewalling
- **Static IPs**: Dedicated outbound IP per sandbox
- **Proxy routing**: Inject secrets through managed egress (credentials stay out of sandboxes)
- **Model gateway**: Single endpoint for all model providers, co-located with agents

SDKs: TypeScript-first (Python at parity). 30 repos on GitHub including sandbox, SDK, MCP hub, and OpenClaw plugin.

## Assessment

Blaxel is the enterprise-grade counterpart to E2B. Where E2B focuses on ephemeral sandbox creation/destruction, Blaxel adds persistence (Agent Drive, ~25ms resume from standby), networking controls (egress firewalling, static IPs, secret injection), and compliance certifications (SOC 2, HIPAA, ISO 27001). The $0 idle cost with snapshot storage is compelling for agents that run intermittently.

The tradeoff is lock-in: Blaxel is proprietary cloud infrastructure with no self-hosting option. smolagents integrates with Blaxel as a sandbox backend (alongside E2B and Docker), so adoption doesn't require framework-level commitment. OpenAI named it a Tier-1 sandbox provider for their Agents SDK.

Pricing: memory-tier based (XS/2GB at $0.0828/hr to XL/32GB at $1.3248/hr), billed per second, $0 compute while idle.

## Mechanical details

```typescript
import { SandboxInstance } from "@blaxel/core";
const sandbox = await SandboxInstance.create({ name: "my-sandbox", image: "blaxel/ts-app:latest" });
await sandbox.fs.write("/app/index.ts", code);
const out = await sandbox.process.exec({ command: "npx tsx /app/index.ts", waitForCompletion: true });
```

For smolagents: `executor_type="blaxel"` in CodeAgent configuration.

## Security

- **License**: Proprietary — no self-hosting, cloud-only
- **Compliance**: SOC 2, HIPAA, ISO 27001 certified
- **Isolation**: Individual microVMs per sandbox, root filesystem in memory (wiped on destroy)
- **Network**: True egress firewalling, secret injection via proxy routing (credentials never enter sandboxes)
- **Data residency**: US and EU regions available
- **Supply chain**: YC S25, $7.3M seed from First Round, 16 global regions
- **Zero data retention**: All sandbox data wiped on destroy (in-memory root fs)

## Usage notes

- **Sandbox best practices** (applies to Blaxel, E2B, Docker): Set memory/CPU limits, implement execution timeouts, monitor resource usage. Run with minimal privileges, disable unnecessary network access, use env vars for secrets. Keep dependencies minimal with fixed package versions.
- **Blaxel advantage for Approach 1** (code-snippet sandbox): Fast execution with hibernation technology (<25ms startup). Use `executor_type="blaxel"` in smolagents.
