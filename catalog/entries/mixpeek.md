summary: "Multimodal search/retrieval infrastructure ('multimodal data warehouse') running on object storage: typed feature-extraction pipelines turn video/files into queryable timestamped features (scenes, transcripts, faces, OCR, fingerprints), embeddings are generated/stored from 50+ models, and multi-stage retrievers compose filter/join/rerank (advertised <100ms). Integrations include S3, GCS, R2, Mux, LangChain, and MCP. Catalog source is a Mixpeek education video contrasting an 'extract once, upstream of every app' model against a plain vector database."

## What it does

Mixpeek is multimodal search/retrieval infrastructure that its materials position as a "multimodal data warehouse" — the layer that extracts features from raw media once, upstream of every downstream app, rather than each app rebuilding its own chunk→extract→embed→index pipeline. Feature extractors produce typed, timestamped features (scenes, transcripts, faces, OCR, fingerprints); indexes build from those features; and retrievers compose search, filtering, and reranking on top. Embeddings can be generated and stored from 50+ models. The stated contrast with a plain vector database: a vector DB stores vectors, whereas Mixpeek also owns the expensive extraction step and keeps features queryable, so "a new app is a query, not a pipeline."

## Mechanical details

- **Building blocks:** Retrievers (compose multi-stage search — filter, join, rerank; advertised sub-100ms), Feature Extractors (typed pipelines for faces, scenes, transcripts, OCR, fingerprints), Embeddings (50+ models), plus clusters/taxonomies.
- **Storage/integrations:** runs on object storage; integrations listed include S3, GCS, R2, Mux, LangChain, and MCP.
- **Positioned solutions:** creative/media (iconik, Mux), advertising, entertainment, e-commerce visual search, education (lecture/transcript search).
- Offered "hosted for teams." (Source is an educational/marketing video; product mechanics beyond the above were not detailed on the fetched page.)

## Security

- **License:** none stated on the fetched page (commercial product; recorded as NOASSERTION).
- **Hosted-service data flow:** as a managed multimodal warehouse, media/features are processed and stored in Mixpeek's infrastructure — review data-handling terms before sending sensitive media.
- Claims (latency, "extract once") come from vendor materials and are not independently verified here.
