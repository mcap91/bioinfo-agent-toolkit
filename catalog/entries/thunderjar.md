## What it is

Thunderjar is a testing/comparison framework for coding agents. The concept: agent behavior is a non-deterministic function of four variables — codebase state (C), prompt configuration (P), model (M), and harness (H). Thunderjar holds three constant and varies the fourth, then applies objective measurements against the results.

The workflow:
1. Identify a task (typically one already completed manually)
2. Capture a codebase snapshot (commit hash)
3. Check out to that commit, apply prompt configuration, run the task with a specific harness and model
4. Apply measurements: compilation/test pass, file existence assertions, lint compliance, token consumption, correctness checks, subagent spawning behavior

Measurement difficulty tiers:
- **Easy:** Total time, compilation/test pass
- **Medium:** File existence, format compliance, ts-ignore/as-any usage, documentation updates
- **Hard:** Function signature quality, naming, actual correctness (suggested approach: known-output tests against exported functions)

## Mechanical details

- **Status:** Early-stage side project. GitHub repo exists but README content was not extractable at fetch time.
- **Blog post:** https://blacksheepcode.com/posts/coding_agent_testing describes the concept and motivation
- **Relationship:** Complementary to trigger-tree (which measures directive adherence in production sessions); Thunderjar is for controlled A/B-style experiments
- **Inspiration:** Differs from PromptFoo in targeting full coding-agent sessions rather than individual prompt/response evaluation
