summary: Game-dev technique for rendering ground effects (e.g. area-of-effect visuals) without spawning a decal or actor object per effect instance. Time-of-occurrence and location data is written into a texture; a material reads that texture to control how the effect visually appears and disappears over time. A separate data-driven grid system tracks which grid cells a character currently occupies, used to decide when to trigger or clear an effect, rather than each effect instance independently tracking its own lifetime and overlap with other effects. Reported benefit is avoiding the lifetime/overlap bookkeeping cost that scales with the number of independently-spawned decal/actor effects. Demonstrated in Unreal Engine by the two-person dev team of the upcoming roguelike 'Barrow and Blade' as one of three non-standard optimization techniques.

## What it does

A technique for rendering transient ground-area effects (described in the source as "ground effects," e.g. the visual footprint of an area-of-effect ability) without spawning a decal or actor per effect instance. Instead of each effect being its own object that must independently track how long it has existed and whether it overlaps other active effects, the system writes time and location information into a texture whenever an effect occurs. A material then reads that texture to control how the effect visually appears and fades/disappears, driven by the elapsed time encoded per pixel/location rather than by an object's own internal clock.

A separate data-driven grid system runs alongside this: it detects when a character enters or leaves each grid cell, and that detection is what decides when an effect should be triggered or cleared. This replaces per-instance overlap and lifetime tracking (checking whether this effect and that effect intersect, and how long each has been alive) with a single texture plus a single grid query, which the source states "saves having to track the lifetime and overlaps of different ground effects independently, which can get expensive quite quickly" as effect count grows. Demonstrated in Unreal Engine by the two-person dev team of the hack-and-slash roguelike "Barrow and Blade," alongside two other non-standard optimization techniques, targeting a wide range of hardware including the Steam Deck.

## Mechanical details

The source (a short dev-log reel) names the ingredients — a texture storing time and location, a material reading it, and a separate data-driven grid for enter/leave detection — but does not show the shader/material graph, the texture's channel layout, or how "location" is encoded (e.g. world-space UV, per-cell index) within it.

This is one instance of a broader family of time-in-texture ground-effect techniques used elsewhere to the same end — replacing continuously-updated or per-instance geometry/decals with a texture read that encodes elapsed time. Tom Looman's Unreal "rendering character wounds" technique similarly splats data into a render target and fades the resulting mask based on elapsed time, explicitly as a cheaper alternative to decals; render-to-texture ground-trail systems (footprints, tire tracks) take the same approach of writing paint/time data into a persistent texture once rather than re-deriving effect state from live geometry every frame. The common tradeoff these sources document: a persistent texture must be kept in memory and costs something to write into, but it avoids the per-instance lifetime/overlap bookkeeping that an equivalent count of independent decal or actor objects would require.
