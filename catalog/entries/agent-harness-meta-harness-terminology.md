## What it says

A short explainer on why "agent" and "harness" both correctly describe Claude Code and Codex — they name different views of one running system:

- **Model** — the reasoning engine (Claude/GPT predicting tokens).
- **Agent** — the goal-directed behavior that emerges when a model can choose steps, use tools, observe results, and continue working.
- **Harness** — the machinery making that behavior operational: assembles context, exposes tools, executes commands, persists sessions, enforces approvals and sandboxing.

Claude Code and Codex bundle harness machinery around models to deliver coding agents. Both can spawn **sub-agents** — separate agent instances with bounded tasks (research, implementation, review) — but multiple sub-agents still live inside one harness.

A **meta-harness** sits one level higher: Omnigent (often misheard as "Omni Agent") wraps different harnesses behind a common interface so a system can switch or combine them while sharing orchestration, policy, state, sandboxes, cost controls, and collaboration.

## Key takeaways

- The useful distinction: sub-agents divide work *inside* a harness; a meta-harness coordinates *across* harness systems.
- The source itself flags that "meta-harness" is emerging terminology — it is the architecture Omnigent describes, not an industry standard.

## Security

- Terminology explainer; no code. The Omnigent framing originates from that product's own architecture description.
