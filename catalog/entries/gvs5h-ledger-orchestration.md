## What it does

GVS5H introduces ledger-based zero-shot self-orchestration — a training-free method where fresh instances of a single model decompose coding problems and coordinate through a shared filesystem holding a plan, notes, and current solution.

Results on the 100 latest hard LiveCodeBench problems:
- **Qwen3.8-27B** (locally served, open-weight): 69.2% → 92.4% pass@1, slightly exceeding Fable 5's 90.4%
- **GPT-5.6-Terra**: 88.0% pass@1 at 19% of Fable 5's cost
- Gains up to 23.2 percentage points on pinned backends
- Gains are not universal — some models are unchanged or worse

Transcript analysis attributes the gain to decomposition and persistent context. The method requires no fine-tuning or special training — it's purely an inference-time organization technique.

Usage: `--engine multiagent` runs the manager orchestration; `--engine single` is the one-call baseline. Supports OpenAI, Anthropic, DashScope, and OpenRouter backends.

## Mechanical details

- **Coordination**: shared filesystem (plan + notes + current solution)
- **Agents**: fresh instances of the same model, zero-shot
- **Benchmark**: LiveCodeBench (release_v6), 100 latest hard problems
- **Models tested**: 9 open and closed-weight models
- **Runtime**: Python 3.12, uv, datasets, numpy
- **Parallelism**: configurable (--parallel N)

## Security

- **License**: MIT (code), CC BY 4.0 (paper/figures/data)
- **No dangerous patterns**: benchmark runner with filesystem coordination
