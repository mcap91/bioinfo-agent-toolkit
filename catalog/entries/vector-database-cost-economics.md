summary: "Practitioner cost model for vector databases: storage bytes = vector count × dimensions × precision (1M 768-dim float32 vectors ≈ 3GB before index/metadata overhead; dimensions scale storage linearly, so 3072-dim embeddings cost 4x what 768-dim cost); RAM-resident indexes cost roughly 10-50x more per GB than SSD, which is roughly 10x object storage (~$0.023/GB-month raw S3-class rate); production replication (2-3x) and HNSW-style index overhead (1.5-2x raw vector bytes) compound on top; query/write pricing (per-request, per-unit, or folded into storage) can dominate the bill at high QPS independent of storage cost."

## What it does

A cost-accounting framework for vector-database spend, independent of any one vendor.

**Storage cost drivers (multiply together):**
- **Vector count × dimensions × precision** — e.g., 1M vectors at 768 dimensions in float32 ≈ 3GB raw, before indexes or metadata. Dimension count scales storage linearly: 3072-dim embeddings cost 4x what 768-dim embeddings cost to store and search. Quantization reduces this term directly — int8 cuts it ~4x, binary quantization up to ~32x, with a recall tradeoff.
- **Where the vectors live** — RAM is roughly 10-50x more expensive per GB than SSD, and SSD is roughly 10x more expensive than object storage (S3-class storage lists around $0.023/GB-month raw). Architectures that must hold the full index in RAM price accordingly; architectures that tier to disk or object storage and cache only hot data pass the savings through. This is the single biggest cost lever — bigger than any individual vendor's rate card.
- **Replication and index overhead** — production deployments typically replicate 2-3x for availability; HNSW-style graph indexes carry roughly 1.5-2x storage overhead beyond raw vector bytes.

**Query cost as a second, independent meter:** some vendors bill per read/write "unit," some per request, some fold moderate query volume into the storage price. For high-QPS retrieval workloads, query pricing can dominate the bill entirely, independent of how cheap storage is.

**Structural pattern:** engines priced on provisioned RAM clusters (classic self-managed Qdrant/Milvus deployments) are cost-predictable but bill for peak capacity around the clock, regardless of actual utilization. Engines priced on object storage with a cache layer in front (turbopuffer-class, Mixpeek MVS-class architectures) bill closer to raw S3 economics for data at rest, typically undercutting RAM-resident architectures by 5-10x on storage-heavy, moderate-QPS workloads — the profile most RAG and agent-memory systems actually have. The tradeoff is cold-query latency: a namespace not recently queried pays object-storage read latency until it's cached.

**Workload-shape guidance:** free tiers cover prototypes with no real traffic. Storage-heavy/moderate-QPS workloads (RAG, media libraries, agent memory) favor object-storage-backed engines. Latency-critical/high-QPS workloads favor provisioned RAM clusters or hot-cache tiers, where per-query pricing should be evaluated before storage pricing. Billion-scale deployments require quantization and storage tiering regardless of vendor, and self-hosting shifts the bill from vendor fees to infrastructure cost plus operational time (realistic self-hosted floor cited at ~$50+/month in instance cost alone, before factoring ops time).
