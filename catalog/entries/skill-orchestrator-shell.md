summary: "Composition pattern: group thematically related agent skills and add a thin orchestrator skill that only routes and sequences between them and enforces explicit sign-off checkpoints, keeping the actual task instructions inside the individual skills rather than the orchestrator."

## What it says

A discussion post describes a technique for reducing ambiguity when many independent skills are installed at once: instead of leaving the model to decide unsupervised which skill to use and when, group related skills by theme and add an orchestrator skill on top with explicit instructions on how the model should sequence and use the underlying skills. The author demonstrated this by grouping two existing marketing-skill repos (`coreyhaines31/marketingskills` and `msitarzewski/agency-agents`) and adding an orchestrator layer. Reported effects: better answers, guardrail adherence (the model stops for sign-offs between phases rather than running them all in one reply), and sequential phase ordering (PMM positioning → Demand Gen Acquisition → Ops Tracking) with structured next steps at each stage.

A reply in the same thread extends the idea into an explicit design rule: the orchestrator should be a thin shell that only routes and sequences — the substantive instructions belong in the individual skills it calls, not in the orchestrator itself. Cramming task instructions into the orchestrator is named as the common failure mode. The reply also isolates the sign-off guardrail as the most load-bearing piece: without an explicit stop point (e.g. one line — "stop after this phase and wait for approval before continuing") the model will chain all phases into a single reply, eliminating the human checkpoint between steps.

## Key takeaways

- **Thin orchestrator, fat skills.** Keep routing/sequencing logic in the orchestrator; keep domain instructions in the individual skills. Mixing the two makes the orchestrator harder to reason about and the skills less reusable standalone.
- **Explicit sign-off lines change behavior disproportionately.** A single sentence telling the model to stop and wait for approval after a phase is described as making the difference between an unsupervised chain of actions and a checkpointed workflow.
- **Grouping by theme reduces routing ambiguity.** Installing many similar skills side by side without an organizing layer leaves the model to guess which one applies and in what order; an orchestrator with sequencing instructions removes that guesswork.
- No dedicated repository accompanies this specific technique — it is a composition pattern applied to two pre-existing, independently cataloged skill collections, not a standalone installable artifact.

## Security

This is a prompting/composition pattern described in a discussion thread, not software. No code, dependencies, or installation surface to assess. The underlying skill repos referenced (`coreyhaines31/marketingskills`, `msitarzewski/agency-agents`) were not independently fetched or assessed as part of this entry.
