summary: Game-dev animation technique for pixel art sprites. Animating detailed pixel art frame by frame from the start is slow — each pose requires precise pixel placement, and fixing a bad pose means redoing detail work. A blockout instead assigns each body part (arm, leg, head, torso, weapon) a distinct flat color with no internal detail, producing a rough colored-blob version of the sprite. The full animation is blocked out first using only these color blobs, which is faster to pose and easier to revise since there is no detail to preserve; the blockout can be previewed and tested in-engine to validate timing and motion before any detail work begins. Once the blocked-out motion reads correctly, each pose is detailed individually — adding detail on top of an established pose is reported as easier than freehanding a detailed pose from scratch. Framed as an extension of the general game-dev 'blockout' practice (used for roughing in level geometry/environment art before detailing) applied to sprite animation, and overlaps with the traditional animation concepts of blocking/pose-to-pose workflows and silhouette-based pose readability checks.

## What it does

A pixel-art sprite animation workflow that separates the motion problem from the detail-art problem. Animating directly in full detail, frame by frame, from the first pose is slow: each new pose requires precise pixel-level redrawing, and if the pose or timing turns out wrong, fixing it means reworking finished detail art rather than a quick sketch.

A blockout avoids this by assigning each body part (e.g. arm, leg, head, torso, weapon) a single distinct flat color with no internal shading, outline detail, or texture — producing a rough, instantly-recognizable colored-blob version of the sprite where every part is visually distinguishable from every other part. The entire animation (every frame/pose) is blocked out first using only these color blobs. Because there is no detail to preserve, each blockout pose is faster to draw and far cheaper to revise — a bad pose or awkward transition can be reworked by moving blobs around rather than redrawing pixel art. The blockout version can be dropped into the game and tested in-engine, so timing, spacing, and overall motion readability are validated before any time is spent on final art.

Once the blocked-out animation reads correctly in motion, detail (shading, outlines, textures) is added pose by pose on top of the now-finalized blockout. Adding detail to an already-correct pose is reported as substantially easier than freehanding a fully detailed pose from a blank frame, since the proportions, silhouette, and pose have already been solved.

The technique is presented as an application of the broader game-dev "blockout" practice — roughing in level geometry or environment layout with simple placeholder shapes before detailing — to 2D sprite animation specifically. It overlaps conceptually with traditional animation's blocking/pose-to-pose workflow (key poses before polish) and with silhouette-readability checks (a pose should read clearly as a flat shape before detail is added); the pixel-art version adds per-body-part color coding so individual limbs stay distinguishable within the flat-shape stage.
