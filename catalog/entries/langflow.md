## What it does

Langflow is an open-source platform for visually building, testing, and deploying LLM-powered agent workflows. Users drag-and-drop components (LLM nodes, vector store connectors, tool nodes, logic gates) into a graph in a browser UI, then Langflow executes them as a Python-backed pipeline. Every completed flow can be published as a REST API endpoint or as an MCP server, making it callable from any MCP client. It ships with support for all major LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, etc.), vector databases (Chroma, Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.), and common AI tools out of the box. A desktop app (Windows/macOS) bundles all Python dependencies for zero-setup local use.

## Assessment
Watch — Langflow is a well-maintained, actively developed project backed by DataStax with a large contributor base (1000+). Its MCP-server export feature is directly relevant to this toolkit's direction (catalog-mcp, kb-dispatch), and its multi-agent orchestration patterns are worth studying. However, the framework is architecturally misaligned with the code-first, CLI-driven philosophy here: it requires running a persistent web server, brings a heavy frontend + Python dependency graph, and targets visual/no-code users more than programmatic agent authors. It is not something to install or depend on directly, but the MCP-export and visual-debugging patterns are worth tracking as the agentic tooling space matures.

## Mechanical details

- **Install:** `uv pip install langflow` (Python 3.10–3.14 required) or Docker (`langflowai/langflow:latest`)
- **Run:** `uv run langflow run` — launches a local server at http://127.0.0.1:7860
- **Desktop app:** Bundled installer for Windows and macOS, no manual Python env setup
- **MCP export:** Any built flow can be served as an MCP server, exposing it as a callable tool for MCP clients
- **API export:** Flows also publish as REST endpoints or exportable JSON for use in Python apps
- **Customization:** Individual nodes are Python classes; source access lets developers swap or extend any component
- **Observability:** Native LangSmith and LangFuse integration for tracing
- **Enterprise tier:** DataStax Astra platform for hosted/enterprise deployments

## Security

License is MIT — no copyleft or commercial restrictions. The project is actively maintained with CI on GitHub and a published security policy (`SECURITY.md`). The primary risk is operational: running Langflow opens a local HTTP server on port 7860; if deployed on a shared or cloud host without auth, flows and any embedded credentials/API keys are potentially reachable. The dependency surface is large (full Python backend + React frontend + optional DB connectors), which increases vulnerability exposure over time and warrants periodic dependency auditing. No dangerous patterns (eval-of-user-input, shell injection, unsafe deserialization) are visible from the README, but the surface area is too large to assess from README alone. For self-hosted production use, network isolation and reverse-proxy auth are advisable.
