summary: "Eye-tracking study (n=53) comparing how code rendering strategies (static, token-by-token, AST-based structured) affect programmer visual attention — structured rendering reveals code in syntactic chunks (outer blocks before inner details), inducing deeper processing and better structural awareness than character-based streaming; argues rendering is a first-class interaction primitive for AI coding tools"

## What it says

Paper by Su et al. (arXiv 2609.24616, September 2026) arguing that how AI-generated code is rendered to the programmer matters as much as what is generated. Standard approaches — static block reveal or token-by-token streaming — reflect model generation order, not how programmers actually read code (selectively, non-linearly, structure-guided).

They introduce **structured rendering**: code revealed in semantically meaningful chunks derived from the AST hierarchy, exposing high-level structure (function signatures, control flow) before low-level details (loop bodies, expressions). Vertical rails mark nesting depth.

Eye-tracking study with 53 participants comparing three modes:

- **Static**: all code appears at once. Enables expert-like scanning with user control.
- **Character-based (token streaming)**: standard LLM output. Forces sequential attention, induces fewer but longer fixations.
- **Structured**: AST-based chunked reveal. Guides attention toward semantically meaningful units, supports high-level understanding, favored over character-based by participants.

Key finding: quiz-based assessments miss the differences — eye-tracking reveals distinct cognitive effort patterns invisible to outcome-only measures. Dynamic rendering provides attentional guidance that helps manage cognitive load, but structured rendering further improves structural awareness.
