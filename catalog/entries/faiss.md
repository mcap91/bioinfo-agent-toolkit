## What it does

FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors, searching sets of vectors of any size including those that do not fit in RAM. Written in C++ with complete Python/NumPy wrappers. Developed at Meta's Fundamental AI Research group. ~40K GitHub stars.

Supports three distance metrics: L2 (Euclidean), dot product, and cosine similarity. Index types range from exact brute-force search to approximate methods trading accuracy for speed and memory. Reported to index 1.5 trillion 144-dimensional vectors for internal Meta applications. Used as a core component in vector databases like OpenSearch, Milvus, and Vearch.

## Differentiators

- **Scale**: Handles billion-scale vector sets on a single server via compressed representations (binary vectors, compact quantization codes)
- **GPU acceleration**: Drop-in GPU index replacements (e.g., `GpuIndexFlatL2`) for NVIDIA CUDA and AMD ROCm, with automatic CPU/GPU memory management; optional cuVS backend for NVIDIA GPU implementations
- **Index variety**: Multiple index structures — flat (exact), IVF (inverted file), PQ (product quantization), HNSW, NSG, RaBitQ — each with different search-time/quality/memory tradeoffs
- **Mature**: Published research backing (IEEE TBD 2019, arXiv 2024), extensive wiki documentation, active community via GitHub Discussions, latest release v1.14.2

## Mechanical details

Install via conda (`faiss-cpu`, `faiss-gpu`, `faiss-gpu-cuvs`) or build from source with cmake. Only dependency is a BLAS implementation. GPU support requires CUDA or ROCm. Python interface wraps the C++ core.

Core API: create an index, `add()` vectors, `search()` for k-nearest neighbors. Training step required for quantization-based indexes. Supports single and multi-GPU configurations.

## Security

MIT licensed. Maintained by Meta with 7 named core contributors, ~4.4K forks. No credential handling or network access — pure computation library. Dependencies minimal (BLAS + optional CUDA).
