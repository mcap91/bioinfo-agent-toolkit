## What it says

A Reddit/social media guide describing two standalone Claude prompting techniques:

**1. Decision Pressure-Test (4-step loop)**
A structured prompt that forces Claude to steelman a decision, red-team it, argue the opposite position, then deliver a calibrated verdict. Designed to surface blind spots before committing to a course of action.

**2. Context Handoff**
A technique for recovering from long-running chats where context degradation causes Claude to lose coherence or repeat itself. The user asks Claude to compress the session into a structured handoff document with six fixed sections — OBJECTIVE, KEY DECISIONS, CURRENT STATE, CONSTRAINTS & PREFERENCES, OPEN THREADS, IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP — then pastes that document into a fresh conversation to resume with a clean context window.

Both techniques include complete copy-paste prompts.

## Assessment

These are lightweight, zero-install prompting patterns applicable to any Claude workflow. Neither requires code, infrastructure, or external tools. The handoff pattern in particular is directly relevant to this project (kb-dispatch already uses a similar structured-handoff approach). They belong in the catalog as a note/reference rather than a full adopt verdict because they are informal community techniques with no formal publication, versioning, or maintenance.

## What to adopt

- **Context handoff prompt**: directly applicable when any agent session runs long. The six-section structure (OBJECTIVE, KEY DECISIONS, CURRENT STATE, CONSTRAINTS & PREFERENCES, OPEN THREADS, IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP) is a clean template. The existing `handoff` skill in this repo serves a similar purpose and could absorb or reference this structure.
- **Decision pressure-test prompt**: useful for any decision gate in an agent workflow where a steelman/red-team pass is warranted before committing.

## Security

No security concerns. These are plain text prompts with no code execution, network access, or external dependencies. Standard prompt-injection hygiene applies if user-supplied content is fed into the templates.
