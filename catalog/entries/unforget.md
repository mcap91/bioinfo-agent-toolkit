## What it does

Scans multiple hiding spots where deferred work tends to accumulate — Deferred.md, plan files, memory entries, TODO docs, and code TODOs — and consolidates findings into an UNFORGET.md file with 10-column rating tables. The signature column is Target, with values THIS (current session), NEXT (next session), LATER (someday), and SOMEDAY (backlog). A `/unforget promote` command handles release cycle transitions, moving NEXT items to THIS when a session begins. The key insight is that Unforget addresses a different problem than a wiki: a wiki tracks what you put into it, while Unforget finds what escaped tracking.

## Assessment
kb wiki tracks what you explicitly create records for — it assumes you'll create a record for everything important. Unforget assumes things escape. These are complementary problem spaces, not overlapping ones. The "scan for escaped items" pattern is genuinely useful and kb has no equivalent. However, this is a Reddit r/claudeskills post rather than a maintained tool, and the concept is simple enough to implement as a native kb lint rule.

**The escaped-items pattern**: A "sweep" or "audit" command that scans the repo for TODOs, deferred markers, and plan files that don't have corresponding wiki records. This is a gap in kb lint — it validates records that exist but doesn't detect work that was never recorded.

**What kb could learn**: A `kb lint --sweep` or `kb audit` command that scans for:
- TODO/FIXME/HACK comments in code without linked wiki issues
- Deferred.md or DEFERRED.md files without corresponding wiki records
- Plan files (PLAN.md, plan-*.md) without linked wiki initiatives
- Memory entries marked "revisit" or "later" without wiki issues

## Mechanical details

Do not install. The concept is the value, not the tool. Implementing the sweep pattern natively in kb lint would be more useful than a separate scanner that doesn't understand kb's record schema. If a future kb lint rule is implemented, the UNFORGET.md rating table format (10-column with Target column) is a useful reference for what a consolidation output could look like.

## Security

Unforget is a Claude Code skill distributed as a Reddit post rather than a published package, so there is no installation surface, no dependency chain, and no executable binary to audit. The "tool" is entirely prompt text that the user copies into their own skill file — the security boundary is the same as any custom slash command: only what you paste into the skill runs, and it only reads local files (TODO comments, plan files, memory entries) with no network access or external calls.

No security flags apply. The swept file paths are local and read-only by design; the only write is to UNFORGET.md in the project root. Users who adopt the sweep pattern natively in kb lint (the recommended path per this entry's verdict) inherit whatever sandboxing kb already applies to lint commands.
