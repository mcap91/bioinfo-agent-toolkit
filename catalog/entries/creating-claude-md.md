## What it does

Scans a repo (manifests, linters, git history), then asks 6 targeted questions — gotchas, scope, approvals, testing, external docs, and reasoning preferences — before generating a CLAUDE.md. Enforces a hard cap at 80 lines with overflow to `agent_docs/`. Refuses to include rules that duplicate linter config, personality prompts, or pasted documentation. The 80-line philosophy reflects a real maintenance insight: CLAUDE.md files that grow without discipline become noise.

## Assessment
The `/init` skill already performs repo-scanning CLAUDE.md generation and is installed in this stack. There is no capability gap. The 80-line cap philosophy is worth keeping as a maintenance guideline for our own CLAUDE.md, but the tool itself adds no workflow value beyond what init provides.

## Mechanical details

No additional install needed — the `/init` skill covers this use case. If the 80-line cap discipline is wanted as a standalone rule, add it as a comment or constraint in the project CLAUDE.md rather than adopting this generator.

## Security

This is a pure Markdown skill file with no runtime code, compiled artifacts, or network calls of its own. It is distributed under the MIT license and installs via a plain `git clone` into the local `~/.claude/skills/` directory. There is no install script, no binary, and no dependency manifest — the attack surface is limited to the SKILL.md content itself, which an agent reads and interprets. The principal risk is prompt-injection in the skill text; review the file before installing, especially after upstream updates.
