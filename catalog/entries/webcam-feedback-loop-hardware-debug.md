summary: "Anecdote of a coding agent (Opus 5.5 via Claude Code) suggesting its own instrumentation for a hardware task it couldn't otherwise observe: pointing a webcam at a physical ESP32-driven display so the agent could see the live rendered output while tuning Waveshare display-driver settings for portrait-mode frame rate, going from 4fps to 60fps in a few minutes once it had that visual feedback loop."

## What it says

The poster describes building an ESP32-based clock/display project with a Waveshare screen, where the portrait-mode drivers performed poorly (4fps). Mid-session, Opus 5.5 suggested pointing a webcam at the physical screen so it could observe what was actually happening on the display while it experimented with driver settings to find the maximum achievable frame rate. Using the webcam feed as ground truth, the agent reached 60fps within a couple of minutes. The toolchain install and clock layout design had already been done earlier in the same session. The poster frames the notable part as the agent's own suggestion to add a camera as a sensor, not the resulting code.

## Key takeaways

- When an agent is driving hardware whose actual visual output it can't read back through any API (no framebuffer dump, no serial render log), a camera pointed at the physical result gives it ground truth to iterate against — the same closed-loop-verification shape as screenshot-based TV debloat patterns (see overlapping entries), applied to physical displays rather than a remote-controllable screen.
- The instrumentation idea originated from the model itself mid-task, not from a human-authored script or prior plan.

## What to adopt

The reusable shape: for an embedded/display/robotics task where the agent cannot directly introspect the physical result, add a camera as a feedback sensor and have the agent read frames back between iterations of a change, rather than relying solely on the device's own (possibly absent or unreliable) status reporting.

## Security

N/A — no code, dependencies, or device access beyond a webcam pointed at the user's own hardware; no claims to verify beyond the poster's own frame-rate numbers.
