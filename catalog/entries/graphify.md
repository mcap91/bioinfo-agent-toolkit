## What it does

Transforms codebases, documentation, and multimedia into interactive knowledge graphs using a three-stage pipeline. Stage 1 extracts via tree-sitter AST (31 languages, local, no API calls) plus LLM semantic extraction for docs/PDFs/images and faster-whisper for audio/video. Stage 2 semantically enriches: comments tagged `# NOTE:`, `# WHY:`, `# HACK:` become separate nodes; docstrings and design rationale are extracted; edges get confidence tags (EXTRACTED, INFERRED, AMBIGUOUS). Stage 3 runs community detection via Leiden clustering, identifying "god nodes" (highest-degree hubs) and surprising cross-module connections. Output is `graphify-out/graph.html` (interactive visualization), `GRAPH_REPORT.md` (human-readable summary), and `graph.json` (queryable JSON). Registers as a `/graphify` skill so agents can issue `graphify query "<question>"` for scoped queries instead of reading full files.

## Why this verdict

Graphify is the direct inspiration for kb graph — the concept of making implicit project understanding explicit and agent-accessible, and the graph-as-queryable-knowledge-base pattern rather than just a visualization, both originated here. The comparison below shows where kb graph has caught up and where it hasn't.

| Feature | Graphify | kb graph |
|---|---|---|
| Input sources | Code (31 langs), docs, PDFs, images, video | Wiki records, code files, docs |
| Parsing | tree-sitter AST (local) + LLM (for docs) | Static analysis of imports/references |
| Edge types | Calls, imports, data flow, semantic relationships | Structural relationships (depends_on, blocks, references) |
| Confidence | Three-level: EXTRACTED, INFERRED, AMBIGUOUS | Binary (present or not) |
| Enrichment | Design rationale as nodes, comment extraction | No rationale extraction |
| Clustering | Leiden community detection, god nodes | No clustering |
| Output | Interactive HTML + JSON + markdown report | .graph.json + graph-summary.md |
| Query interface | `/graphify query` skill | kb graph CLI + search index |

**What kb graph could still learn from Graphify**:

1. **Confidence-tagged edges** — EXTRACTED vs INFERRED vs AMBIGUOUS; kb graph currently has binary edges with no certainty signal
2. **Design rationale as nodes** — `# WHY:` comments becoming queryable entities, making intent searchable not just structure
3. **Community detection / clustering** — Leiden algorithm to identify god nodes and unexpected cross-module dependencies
4. **Interactive HTML visualization output** — kb graph produces JSON and markdown but no interactive visual

## Mechanical details

Install from GitHub. Requires tree-sitter for code parsing (local, no API calls for code extraction) and an LLM API for doc/multimedia extraction. The `/graphify query` interface is the primary agent integration point. Not recommended for installation — kb graph covers the core use case and this would be a parallel graph system. Study the source for the confidence tagging and clustering concepts rather than running it alongside kb.
