summary: "Vendor explainer of the MCP 2026-07-28 stateless spec, used as content marketing for apito.ai — a third-party 'model-access layer' that resells/proxies Claude and Claude-compatible API traffic (migrate by swapping the request domain from claudeapi.com to an apito.ai endpoint). Proposes a 3-layer agent architecture (model access / tool connection = MCP / business workflow). Security caution: routing keys, prompts, and completions through a non-Anthropic proxy is a trust-boundary/data-exposure risk; spec claims are secondary vendor-sourced."

## What it does

apito.ai (self-branded alongside "ClaudeAPI") is a commercial **model-access gateway**: a third-party endpoint that resells/proxies access to Claude and Claude-compatible models. The page positions it in the "model access layer" of an agent stack — API keys, Claude-compatible model access, request logging, usage/cost visibility, team- and tool-level config, routing, and failover. Adoption is described as swapping the request domain from `claudeapi.com` to a corresponding `apito.ai` endpoint, keeping model names and request parameters mostly unchanged.

The ingested page (`/en/blog/tools/mcp-stateless-architecture-apito/`) is a vendor explainer of the **MCP 2026-07-28 specification** used as content marketing. Its technical claims mirror the neutral coverage already cataloged in [[mcp-2026-07-28-spec]]: stateless protocol core; removal of the `initialize`/`initialized` handshake and `Mcp-Session-Id`; per-request metadata via `_meta`; optional `server/discover`; `Mcp-Method`/`Mcp-Name` routing headers; Extensions; Tasks; and MCP Apps (sandboxed server-rendered iframes whose UI actions share the tool-call audit/consent path).

Its one distinct contribution is a **three-layer agent architecture** framing:

1. **Model access layer** — routing, keys, base-URL config, logs, billing, failover (where apito.ai places itself).
2. **Tool connection layer** — MCP (GitHub, DBs, files, browsers, internal APIs).
3. **Business workflow layer** — the actual work (coding, research, reports, support).

The thesis: keep these layers separate so the model can be swapped without rewriting tools, and tool growth doesn't create permission chaos. The page closes with a stateless-migration checklist (session dependency, per-call authorization, logging, multi-tenancy, horizontal scaling, high-risk-tool approvals).

## Assessment

Useful only for the **layered-architecture framing** and as a plain-language restatement of the stateless-MCP shift; on the spec itself, [[mcp-2026-07-28-spec]] is the better, neutrally-sourced reference. This is an SEO-oriented vendor blog whose spec claims are secondary — verify against the official MCP spec/blog (which it cites) before relying on any detail.

The product itself — a **third-party Claude API reseller/proxy** — is the reason to catalog this as a caution, not an endorsement. These gateways are common where direct Anthropic access is restricted, but they interpose a non-Anthropic party between you and the model.

## Security

Routing Claude traffic through apito.ai/ClaudeAPI means your **API keys, prompt content, and completions traverse a third-party proxy** not affiliated with Anthropic (the page discloses this independence explicitly). Trust-boundary and data-exposure risk: the operator can in principle observe, log, or retain requests and responses, and controls the endpoint your agents call. Do **not** route production or sensitive workloads through it without an explicit trust decision, contractual data terms, and dedicated, tightly-scoped keys. Provenance is low — vendor self-description with unverifiable operational claims. Consistent with this catalog's model, the security boundary is at adoption: treat any migration of the request domain as a deliberate, reviewed change.
