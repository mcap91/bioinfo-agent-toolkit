## What it does

HTTP web server, reverse proxy, content cache, load balancer, TCP/UDP proxy server, and mail proxy server. One of the most widely deployed web servers globally, used for serving static content, reverse-proxying to application servers, load balancing, and SSL termination.

## Differentiators

- **Event-driven architecture** — handles thousands of concurrent connections with minimal memory footprint
- **Mature and battle-tested** — in production since 2004, powers a significant share of the internet's web traffic
- **njs scripting** — JavaScript scripting engine (njs 1.0.0 released June 2026, now using QuickJS engine)
- **Active maintenance** — stable (1.30.x) and mainline (1.31.x) release tracks with regular security patches

## Mechanical details / What to adopt

- Available via package managers on all major platforms
- Configuration via declarative config files (`nginx.conf`)
- Enterprise distributions from F5, Inc. with commercial support and training
