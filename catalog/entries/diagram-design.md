## What it does

A coding-agent skill that generates editorial-quality diagrams as self-contained HTML+SVG files. No build step, no JavaScript dependencies, no external images. Opens in any browser, offline.

42 visual types: architecture, IT current-state, flowchart, sequence, state machine, ER/data model, timeline, swimlane, quadrant, radar, loop/flywheel, nested hierarchy, tree, org chart, layer stack, Venn, pyramid/funnel, bar chart, treemap, line chart, Gantt, scatter plot, high-level stack, process, medallion, data flow, DP integration, DP security matrix, Sankey, fishbone, Wardley map, kanban, user journey, deployment, dependency graph, UML class, story map, database schema, polar chart, waterfall, architecture delta, exploded axonometric, axonometric plan, heatmap.

Three variants per type: minimal light, minimal dark, and full-editorial.

**Brand onboarding**: point the skill at a URL, it extracts the site's palette + font stack and maps them to semantic tokens (paper, ink, accent, muted, link). WCAG AA contrast checks run automatically. Named profiles support multiple client brands.

**Import**: redraws draw.io, Mermaid, or Excalidraw sources at a chosen format/size/detail/audience level. Four dials: format (html/svg/png), size (doc/slide/social/print), detail (faithful ≤24 / balanced ≤12 / simplified ≤7 nodes), audience (engineer/mixed/executive).

**Semantic patterns**: 9 behavior patterns (fan-in queue, policy trace, paved road, governance catalog, compensating layers, etc.) that select layout type automatically based on what the diagram describes.

## Mechanical details

Install: `npx skills add cathrynlavery/diagram-design` (cross-agent), or via marketplace for Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, Factory Droid, Pi. Progressive loading — only SKILL.md + one type reference loaded per request.

Design system: Instrument Serif titles, Geist sans node names, Geist Mono sublabels, 1px hairlines, no shadows, max 10px border-radius, all coords divisible by 4. One accent color, 1-2 focal elements per diagram. 87 monochrome icons (Tabler Icons MIT, Simple Icons CC0).

CI: lint-skin.py (source), lint-render.py (headless Chromium rendered output), geometry verification (label placement, diagonal connectors, port spacing), treemap area accuracy, waterfall conservation, Sankey conservation, block registry, docs sync. Cross-platform CI (Linux/Windows/macOS).

PNG export requires Playwright + Chromium (`pip install playwright && playwright install chromium`).
