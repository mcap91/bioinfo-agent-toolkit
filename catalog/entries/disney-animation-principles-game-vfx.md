summary: Game-dev technique for making a combat VFX effect (demonstrated on a thrown fireball) read as satisfying by applying five of Disney's twelve classical animation principles instead of adding more particles or better shaders — anticipation (the hero leans back while the fire gathers, then throws), squash and stretch (the fireball stretches in flight, the enemy squashes on hit), follow through (the hero's body settles after the throw, the trail lags behind, the burst flies on), timing (freeze the game for a few frames on the hit, i.e. hit-stop), and arcs (the fireball, sparks, and damage numbers travel on curved rather than straight paths). Framed as the same underlying asset read as flat or alive purely based on which of these principles are layered on top, independent of particle count or shader quality.

## What it does

Demonstrates, via a before/after fireball VFX comparison, that five of Disney's classical animation principles — not particle count or shader quality — are what make a game effect feel alive. The reel pairs each principle with a concrete application to a thrown-fireball attack: (1) **anticipation** — the hero leans back while the fire gathers before throwing, signaling the action before it happens; (2) **squash and stretch** — the fireball stretches along its flight path, and the enemy squashes on impact, communicating velocity and force; (3) **follow through** (and overlapping action) — the hero's body continues settling after the throw, the fireball's trail lags behind the head of the effect, and the burst continues expanding after the main impact; (4) **timing** — the game briefly freezes on the hit (a hit-stop/freeze-frame), giving the impact weight; (5) **arcs** — the fireball, its sparks, and the resulting damage numbers all travel on curved rather than straight paths. The claimed takeaway is that the same base asset (particles, glow, fireball shape) reads as flat in the "before" version and satisfying in the "after" version purely from applying these five principles, and that the principles themselves are roughly 90 years old (attributed to Disney animators of the 1930s) and still apply directly to real-time game VFX.
