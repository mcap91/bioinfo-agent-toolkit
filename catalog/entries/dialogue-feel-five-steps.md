summary: Game-dev technique for making NPC dialogue feel alive instead of appearing as a flat wall of text, via five layered presentation steps — (1) typewriter effect reveals letters one at a time so the player reads along at the character's pace; (2) pauses hold a short beat on each comma and period, giving the line timing instead of a flat reading speed; (3) a tiny sound blip plays on every revealed letter, pitched to suit the speaking character; (4) text effects apply per-word motion keyed to tone, e.g. happy words wave and angry words shake; (5) the speaker's portrait or model bobs while talking and its facial expression switches between states (e.g. happy to furious) tied to the line's content. Framed as a reusable layered presentation pipeline independent of the actual dialogue content — the same line of text reads as flat or as a performed character purely from how these five steps are applied on top of it.

## What it does

A five-step layered presentation pipeline for NPC dialogue, contrasted against a plain baseline (the full line of text appearing on screen all at once). The steps: (1) typewriter — letters are revealed one at a time instead of all at once, so the player reads along at the pace the line is delivered; (2) pauses — playback holds a short beat on each comma and period, giving the line timing rather than a constant per-character reveal speed; (3) sound — a short blip sound plays on every letter as it's revealed, pitched to match the speaking character; (4) text effects — per-word motion is keyed to the word's tone, e.g. happy words wave and angry words shake, while the speaker's face stays static; (5) the speaker — the speaker's portrait or model bobs along while talking, and its facial expression switches between states (e.g. happy to furious) as the line progresses. Presented as a reusable five-layer pipeline: the same dialogue text reads as flat or as a performed character purely from how many of these layers are applied, independent of what the line actually says.
