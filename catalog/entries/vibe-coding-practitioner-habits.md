title: Vibe Coding Practitioner Habits (Pre-AI Developer Perspective)
category: reference
summary: "Experienced developer's framework for effective AI-assisted development: plan before prompting, break work into small pieces, read and understand generated code, ask 'why' before accepting fixes, maintain your own architectural mental model, challenge the AI on edge cases and alternatives, and learn fundamentals alongside it; core thesis is that AI becomes a force multiplier only when the developer can explain the system without AI — otherwise the AI starts leading instead of assisting"

## What it does

Practitioner reflection from a pre-AI developer on why "vibe coding" fails for many people and the habits that make it work. Core argument: AI doesn't replace thinking — it requires understanding the full blueprint (architecture, schema, auth, state, security, feature connections) to steer effectively. When developers let AI make architectural decisions, each fix stacks on the last until the codebase becomes inconsistent and unrecoverable.

**Seven habits:**
1. Plan before you prompt — know what the feature does, what data it needs, how it fits
2. Break work into small pieces — one feature at a time, test, understand, move on
3. Read the code it gives you — understand why it works and what else it affects
4. Ask "why?" not just "fix it" — understand the cause before accepting a patch
5. Keep track of your architecture — know where database logic, auth, state, APIs, and permissions live
6. Challenge the AI — ask about downsides, edge cases, security issues, simpler approaches
7. Learn fundamentals alongside it — the more you understand programming, the easier it is to spot when AI is guessing

Core test: if you can explain your application without AI, AI becomes a massive accelerator. If you can't, it starts leading you.
