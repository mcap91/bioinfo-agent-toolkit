## What it covers

A 128-comment Reddit discussion distilling practitioner strategies for managing 3+ concurrent
AI coding agent sessions. The central problem: tab/pane proliferation leads to lost context,
wrong-session mistakes, and cognitive overload.

## Strategy Categories

### Tool-based multiplexing
- **Herdr / Orca:** Most frequently recommended — orchestrator features, multi-pane views
- **cmux / Supacode:** Sidebar organization with notifications
- **Claude Desktop:** Built-in splitscreen for simpler setups

### Terminal customization
- `/rename` and `/color` commands for basic tab differentiation
- Strict naming rules: `repo-task` format
- Statusline showing repo, branch, and model for constant visibility

### Agent-managing-agents
- One Claude session acts as "tech lead" or "Sentinel" managing others
- Shows promise but shifts the organization problem up one level

### Session-count discipline
- Multiple users found capping at 2-3 sessions with clear briefs improved output quality
  more than any tooling
- Too many parallel sessions correlate with lower quality and more wrong-window mistakes

## Key Failure Mode

Pasting review feedback or instructions into the wrong session/repo. Worktree isolation
(e.g., coldtea-ai giving each agent its own worktree) eliminates write-to-wrong-repo errors
but doesn't solve the attention-routing problem.
