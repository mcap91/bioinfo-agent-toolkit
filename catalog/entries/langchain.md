summary: Open-source (MIT) LLM application framework providing composable components — chains, runnables, tools, retrievers, prompts — for building model-agnostic agents; as of 2026, its create_agent ReAct-pattern agents run on LangGraph's durable runtime, inheriting persistence, checkpointing, rewind, and human-in-the-loop support rather than implementing orchestration independently.

## What it does

A framework for building LLM applications from composable parts: chains (sequences of calls), runnables (the common interface those calls implement), tools, retrievers, and prompts. Historically positioned as the orchestration layer itself, but by 2026 LangChain's own agent constructor (`create_agent`) builds on LangGraph's durable runtime rather than a separate execution model — so LangChain agents inherit LangGraph's persisted state, step-level resumability, and human-in-the-loop checkpoints. Control flow in LangChain proper is mostly sequential with some branching; loops, conditional routing, and multi-agent coordination as first-class constructs are LangGraph's domain. The two layers are separable: LangGraph runs without LangChain's components, and LangChain's components can be used without adopting LangGraph's graph abstraction directly.
