## What it does

tldr-pages provides simplified, example-focused help pages for command-line tools as a complement to traditional man pages. Instead of exhaustive documentation, each page shows the most common use cases with practical examples.

Coverage: UNIX, Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, SunOS, Android, Windows, Cisco IOS, and DOS commands.

Official clients: Python (`pipx install tldr`), Rust (`brew install tlrc` / `cargo install tlrc`), Node.js (`npm install -g tldr`). Web client at tldr.inbrowser.app with offline PWA support. PDF versions available for offline use.

40+ language translations. Community-maintained via GitHub PRs.
