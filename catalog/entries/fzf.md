## What it does

fzf is a general-purpose fuzzy finder for the command line. Pipe any list to it, get interactive fuzzy search with instant results. Also serves as a building block for rich terminal applications via its event-driven architecture.

Key capabilities:
- **Shell integration**: CTRL-R (history search), CTRL-T (file picker), ALT-C (directory jump) for bash, zsh, fish, nushell
- **Fuzzy completion**: `vim **<TAB>`, `cd **<TAB>`, `kill -9 **<TAB>`, `ssh **<TAB>`
- **Preview window**: inline file/image preview with syntax highlighting (via bat/highlight)
- **Display modes**: fullscreen, `--height`, `--popup` (tmux 3.3+/Zellij 0.44+)
- **Search syntax**: fuzzy match, exact (`'word`), prefix (`^music`), suffix (`.mp3$`), inverse (`!fire`), OR (`|`)
- **Programmable bindings**: `become()`, `execute()`, `reload()`, `transform()` for building custom workflows
