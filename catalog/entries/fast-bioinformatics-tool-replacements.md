## What it says

A practitioner's compilation of significantly faster and more lightweight alternatives to standard bioinformatics pipeline tools, motivated by the desire to replace heavy Nextflow/Snakemake official pipelines with leaner custom processing. The replacements are primarily Rust-based reimplementations or modern C/C++ tools.

## Key takeaways

Bioinformatics-specific replacements:
- **FastQC → Falco**: Faster QC for sequencing reads.
- **Bedtools/Deeptools → grit**: Genomic interval and coverage operations. Example: deeptools genomecov taking ~1h30 and 9GB RAM runs in ~10 minutes with ~1KB RAM using grit genomecov.
- **samtools/bamtools/cramtools → sambamba**: Faster BAM/CRAM processing.
- **GATK-Picard → rust-bio-tools**: Rust reimplementations of common variant-calling utilities.
- **IGV plots → rust-bio-tools / alignoth**: Programmatic alignment visualization without IGV.

General Unix CLI replacements:
- **sed → sd**: Simpler syntax, faster text replacement.
- **grep → ripgrep**: Faster recursive text search.
- **du → dust**: Faster disk usage visualization.
- **df → dysk**: Lists mount points separately, outputs JSON.
- **pigz → crabz**: 2x faster than pigz at compression level 6 on text files.
- **wget/curl/rsync/cp → aria2c**: Multi-connection parallel downloads.

## Mechanical details

The performance claims come from direct practitioner benchmarks on real bioinformatics workloads. The grit genomecov comparison (1h30/9GB → 10min/1KB) and crabz vs pigz (2x faster at level 6) are specific measured results. Most replacements are Rust-based, benefiting from zero-cost abstractions and memory safety without GC overhead.

## Security

No single tool to assess — this is a curated replacement list. Individual tools should be evaluated separately before adoption. Most listed tools are open-source with active communities.
