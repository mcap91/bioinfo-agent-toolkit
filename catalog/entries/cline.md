## What it does

Cline turns an editor into an autonomous coding agent: it reads files, writes code, runs terminal commands, drives a browser, and calls MCP tools, iterating on errors without constant hand-holding. By default it requires approval for each file change and command (human-in-the-loop), shows every edit as a reviewable/revertible diff, and tracks checkpoints to undo its own work; an auto-approve toggle allows unattended runs. Project-specific conventions (coding standards, architecture, deployment, testing) go in `.clinerules` files, picked up automatically across the VS Code extension, JetBrains plugin, and CLI. An MCP Marketplace lists third-party tool servers, and a hosted SaaS (Cline.bot) offers free, paid, and enterprise tiers.

## Security

Apache-2.0. Default human-in-the-loop approval for file writes and command execution is a built-in control; auto-approve mode removes that gate and should be scoped deliberately. ~71k GitHub stars, Cline Bot Inc. as a commercial maintainer behind the open-source core.

## Usage notes

- Practitioner report (r/Qwen_AI, Oct 2026): used at work (via Anthropic models on Amazon Bedrock) as the harness for Opus 4.8/5.5, alongside a separate self-optimized Zed + Qwen Code + SearXNG-MCP harness for self-hosted Qwen 3.8 27B.
