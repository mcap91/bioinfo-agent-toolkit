## What it does

Qdrant is a vector similarity search engine and database for storing, searching, and managing vectors with JSON payload metadata. Written in Rust with SIMD optimizations and a custom storage engine (Gridstore).

Core capabilities:

- **Dense, sparse, and multi-vector search**: Supports named vectors per point, enabling ColBERT-style late interaction and multi-modal workflows
- **Inline payload filtering**: Metadata filters applied during HNSW graph traversal (not pre/post-processing), maintaining recall under selective filters
- **Hybrid search**: Combines multiple vector types in a single query with configurable fusion (RRF, DBSF)
- **Quantization**: Scalar, product, and TurboQuant (4-bit/8-bit) compression — up to 32x memory reduction with under 1% recall loss
- **Distributed mode**: Sharding and replication across nodes with zero-downtime resharding
- **GPU indexing**: NVIDIA and AMD GPU support for accelerated index builds
- **Qdrant Edge**: Lightweight in-process variant for edge devices with server sync

Client libraries: Python, Rust, Go, JavaScript/TypeScript, .NET/C#, Java. Community: Kotlin, PHP.
