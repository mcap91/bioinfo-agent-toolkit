summary: Free, open-source 3D creation suite (modeling, sculpting, UV/texturing, rigging, animation, simulation, the Cycles and EEVEE render engines, compositing, video editing, and Grease Pencil 2D-in-3D drawing); scriptable via a Python API that drives the entire tool including a built-in Python console and add-on system; cross-platform (Linux, Windows, macOS); GPL-licensed (sources vary between citing GPL-2.0-or-later and GPL-3.0), free since 1.0 and open-source since 2002 after a community buyout from the original commercial owner (NaN); maintained by the Blender Foundation with an LTS release track (5.2 LTS released 2026-07-14); third-party MCP servers exist that let AI agents drive Blender's Python API over the Model Context Protocol, which is the specific integration referenced (and dismissed) in this entry's source item.

## What it does

Blender is a free, open-source 3D creation suite covering the full content pipeline: modeling, sculpting (multi-resolution and dynamic subdivision, texture-brush painting), UV/texturing, rigging and animation, physics/particle simulation, two render engines (Cycles for path-traced photorealism, EEVEE for real-time/viewport rendering), node-based compositing, basic video editing, and Grease Pencil for 2D drawing directly inside a 3D viewport. It is scriptable end-to-end through a Python API — most of Blender's own UI is itself built on that API — with a built-in Python console and a community add-on ecosystem for extending or automating the tool.

Originally built in-house by a Dutch animation studio (1994), Blender became free and open-source in 2002 after a community fundraiser bought the rights from the original commercial owner (NaN) for roughly €100,000. It now runs cross-platform (Linux, Windows, macOS) under the Blender Foundation, which maintains a Long-Term-Support release track alongside regular releases (5.2 LTS released 2026-07-14).

Because Blender exposes its full feature set through Python, third-party Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers exist (community projects, not shipped by the Blender Foundation) that let an AI agent drive Blender — creating/editing geometry, materials, and scenes — by calling that same Python API over MCP. This Blender-via-MCP integration pattern is the specific thing referenced (and dismissed as not worth the effort, in favor of agent-written procedural-generation code) in this entry's source item; no specific MCP server product was named in that item.

## Mechanical details

- License: sources disagree on the exact GPL version cited (GPL-2.0-or-later vs. GPL-3.0); Blender itself is unambiguously copyleft/free-software, and this covers Blender's own source, not content created with it.
- Distribution: official builds for Linux/Windows/macOS from blender.org, plus Steam and package-manager distributions; add-ons installed as Python packages/scripts.
- Python API covers nearly every editable property in the application, which is also how both official and community tooling (render farms, pipeline automation, MCP bridges) control Blender headlessly (`blender --background --python script.py`).

## Security

- `python-scripting-arbitrary-code` — Blender's add-on and scripting system runs arbitrary Python with the permissions of the user running Blender; `.blend` files can embed scripts that execute on open unless disabled in preferences. Treat untrusted `.blend` files and add-ons like any other untrusted executable code.
- `third-party-mcp-code-execution-surface` — Blender-driving MCP servers are community-built, not from the Blender Foundation; by design they let a connected AI agent execute Python inside Blender, which inherits the same arbitrary-code-execution surface as any Blender scripting access. Vet the specific MCP server implementation and its auth/exposure model before granting agent access.

- [Instagram reel](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DeuMK6FJhoc/) — catalog source; creator groups Blender (used via MCP) with Meshy and prebuilt engines as "a waste of time" for AI-accelerated game development, preferring agent-written procedural-generation code instead

## Usage notes

- Gradient-map texturing workflow: a single low-resolution gradient-map image (found by searching "gradient" on itch.io, or made by hand) can texture an entire game's mesh set, relying on Blender's built-in linear interpolation to smooth the pixelated gradient when sampled at different UV positions. Steps: add the gradient image as a texture in the Shader Editor (Ctrl+T adds the texture-coordinate/mapping node chain), set Roughness to 1; in the UV Editor, lock the 3D viewport to front orthographic (Numpad 1), select all, `U` > Project from View, then in the UV editor press `S` `X` `0` to flatten the UV map onto the X axis, and scale/move it to sample a specific color from the gradient strip. Different mesh parts can be selected in Edit Mode and re-unwrapped individually to pick different colors from the same gradient map. For a radial gradient (e.g. a sword blade), rotate the model 90°, project from view, scale/position, then add a Mirror modifier to get a gradient radiating out from the center.
