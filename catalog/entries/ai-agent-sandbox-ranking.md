summary: "Practitioner ranking of open-source sandboxes for AI agents by a SmolVM maintainer (disclosed bias) — criteria are ease of setup, snapshotting, fork/clone, pause/resume, Linux+macOS support, and computer-use/desktop workflows; ranks SmolVM > Microsandbox > OpenSandbox > E2B and argues 'best sandbox' depends on whether agents need persistent state, browsers, or desktops rather than just code execution"

## What it says

A forum post comparing open-source sandbox options for AI agents, written by someone who works on CelestoAI/SmolVM (disclosed up front). Evaluation criteria: easy startup, snapshotting, fork/clone from saved state, pause/resume, cross-OS support (Linux + macOS), and support for computer-use agents / full desktop environments. The ranking is explicitly biased toward agent builders, not generic isolated code execution.

1. **SmolVM** — ranked first: easy local setup, Linux and macOS, snapshotting, pause/resume, persistent sandbox workflows, browser sessions and desktop-style computer-use workflows.
2. **Microsandbox** — local-first and lightweight with simple developer experience; ranked lower because snapshot/clone semantics and desktop support are less clear.
3. **OpenSandbox** — broader platform ambition (GUI agents, desktop/VNC workflows) but a heavier mental model than a local dev tool.
4. **E2B** — best-known option: easy start, pause/resume, desktop sandbox for computer-use, solid hosted experience; ranked lower due to author's preference for local/open infrastructure and tighter control.

## Key takeaways

- "AI sandbox" discussions mix distinct product classes: isolated code runners, full agent sandboxes, browser/desktop/computer-use sandboxes, and platform/control planes — rankings only make sense within a class.
- The differentiating features for agent work are state-related, not execution-related: writing files and returning later, keeping state between turns, running a browser, using a desktop, recovering from interruptions.
- Real snapshotting + fast clone/fork from saved state + pause/resume + dual-OS support is the feature bundle the author found rare.

## What to adopt

- The six evaluation criteria form a reusable checklist when assessing any agent sandbox.
- The class distinction (code runner vs agent sandbox vs computer-use sandbox vs control plane) prevents apples-to-oranges comparisons.

## Security

- Author-disclosed conflict of interest: works on the product ranked first. Treat the ordering as marketing-adjacent; the criteria and taxonomy are the durable content.
- No security assessment of the individual sandboxes is included in the post.
