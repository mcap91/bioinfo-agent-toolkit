## What it is

GSAP Animation Expert is a Claude Code skill that teaches the agent to use the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP) for JavaScript animations. It covers the core GSAP API (to, from, fromTo, set), timeline orchestration with position parameters, ScrollTrigger for scroll-driven animations, stagger configurations (simple, grid-based, function-based), easing functions (power, elastic, bounce, custom bezier), and React integration via the `useGSAP` hook with automatic cleanup.

The skill includes ready-to-use patterns for:
- Reveal-on-scroll animations
- Horizontal scroll sections with snap
- Text split character-by-character reveals
- Logo/loading sequence orchestration
- Pin-and-scrub scroll storytelling

It also covers transform properties (x/y/rotation/scale/skew with 3D variants), special properties (autoAlpha, repeat, yoyo), and performance considerations.
