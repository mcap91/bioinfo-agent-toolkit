## What it is

GeoLibre is a free, open-source, lightweight cloud-native GIS platform for visualizing, exploring, and analyzing geospatial data while keeping data local and private. The same workspace runs as a native desktop app (Windows/macOS/Linux), a native Android app, in any modern web browser, and inside Jupyter notebooks via a Python package, adapting responsively to mobile. It is built with Tauri v2, React, TypeScript, MapLibre GL JS, DuckDB-WASM Spatial, deck.gl, and Turf.js. Capabilities include 3D tiles and extruded city data, a time slider, a SQL workspace, an attribute table, styling/symbology with auto-generated legends, vector and terrain analysis, 700+ browser-side geoprocessing tools, plugins, and embedding. Basemaps cover Earth and planetary bodies (Moon, Mars, Mercury, Venus, the Galilean moons, Titan, Pluto, Charon) with per-project ellipsoids. Authored by Qiusheng Wu (opengeos); releases are archived on Zenodo with a DOI.

## Mechanical details

- **Use:** GeoLibre Web (nothing to install) at geolibre.app; desktop installers for Windows/macOS/Linux; Android app; Docker; or run from source
- **Jupyter:** a Python package provides an in-notebook panel
- Full docs, user guide, and tutorials at geolibre.app; project format, plugin API, and architecture documented in the repo

## Security

MIT licensed. GeoLibre is described as local-first — data stays on the user's device — and processing (including the 700+ tools and DuckDB-WASM Spatial) runs client-side in the app or browser. Optional integrations and remote basemap/tile sources involve outbound requests to those providers. No security flags recorded from the observed material.
