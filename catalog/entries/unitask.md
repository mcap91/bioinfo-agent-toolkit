summary: Cysharp's allocation-free async/await library for Unity — a struct-based UniTask<T> (vs. the heap-allocating Task<T>) that makes Unity's AsyncOperations, Coroutines, and MonoBehaviour/uGUI events awaitable, runs on Unity's PlayerLoop without threads (works on WebGL/wasm), and adds async LINQ (Channel, AsyncReactiveProperty) plus a TaskTracker window for leak detection; commonly used to replace coroutines for timers and sequencing (e.g. day/night cycles); requires Unity 2018.3+ for C# 7.0 task-like builders; 11.3k stars, 1.0k forks; MIT.

## What it does

UniTask provides an efficient, allocation-free async/await integration for Unity, built around a struct-based `UniTask`/`UniTask<T>` type instead of the heap-allocating `System.Threading.Tasks.Task<T>`. It makes Unity's native asynchronous objects — `AsyncOperation`, `ResourceRequest`, `UnityWebRequestAsyncOperation`, and coroutines — directly awaitable, and exposes MonoBehaviour lifecycle/uGUI events as awaitable or async-enumerable streams via `AsyncTriggers`. Because it runs on Unity's PlayerLoop rather than real OS threads or `SynchronizationContext`, it works on platforms coroutines already support, including WebGL and wasm. It's commonly adopted as a coroutine replacement for game-logic sequencing and timers — e.g. driving day/night cycles or periodic crop-growth timers in async methods instead of `IEnumerator` coroutines.

## Mechanical details

Requires Unity 2018.3+ (C# 7.0's task-like custom async method builder feature); officially supported from Unity 2018.4.13f1 onward. Includes Async LINQ operators (`SelectAwait`, etc.) and `Channel`/`AsyncReactiveProperty` primitives for async data streams, plus a TaskTracker editor window to catch leaked/un-awaited tasks. 11.3k GitHub stars, 1.0k forks.
