## What it does

R package for publication-ready GWAS visualizations built on ggplot2. 17 plot types covering the full GWAS-to-post-GWAS analysis pipeline:

- **Core**: Manhattan (with broken y-axis for extreme p-values), QQ (with CI and lambda), Miami (discovery vs replication), locus zoom (with LD and gene track)
- **Novel**: circular Manhattan (multi-ring), enrichment Manhattan, multi-trait Manhattan (pleiotropy overlay), p-value heatmap, effect-size volcano, SNP density karyogram, density-vs-signal, GWAS summary dashboard
- **Post-GWAS**: PheWAS, colocalization, fine-mapping (PIP/SuSiE), genetic correlation (LDSC), architecture plot

Auto-detects column names from PLINK (.assoc/.linear/.logistic), REGENIE, GCTA MLMA, GEMMA, and generic files. Smart downsampling preserves all significant variants while binning non-significant background — renders 10M+ variant datasets in seconds (up to 8.8x faster than qqman). 6 journal themes (Nature, Science, Cell, PLOS, presentation, poster) and 14 colorblind-safe palettes.

Every function returns a composable ggplot object — standard ggplot2 layering, faceting, and theming all work.

## Assessment

Directly relevant to bioinformatics workflows. Fills a major gap — qqman (the current standard) offers only Manhattan and QQ plots with no ggplot2 composability, no post-GWAS visualizations, no journal themes, and no smart downsampling. CMplot adds circular Manhattan but uses base R graphics. ggwas provides all of these plus 10 novel plot types not available in any existing package.

The performance benchmarks are notable: 8.8x faster than qqman on 1.37M variants via intelligent downsampling that preserves visual fidelity. The auto-detection of input formats (PLINK, REGENIE, GCTA, GEMMA) eliminates boilerplate column mapping.

Strong candidate for adoption in any GWAS analysis pipeline. The gene annotation feature (automatic nearest-gene mapping, arrow labels on peaks) and region highlighting (e.g., MHC) are particularly useful for manuscript figures.

## Mechanical details

- Install: `pak::pak("bczech/ggwas")`
- Read data: `read_gwas_table()` auto-detects, or format-specific readers
- All plot functions return ggplot objects — layer with `+`
- Journal presets: `+ theme_nature()`, `+ theme_science()`, etc.
- Gene annotation: `manhattan_genes(gwas, genes = gene_table)`
- Top hits: `top_hits(gwas, genes = gene_table, p_threshold = 5e-8)`

## Security

MIT license. Pure R visualization package with no network calls, no code execution beyond ggplot2 rendering. Standard CRAN-style dependencies. No security concerns.
