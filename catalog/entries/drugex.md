## What it does

DrugEx generates novel drug-like small molecules using deep learning generative models
within a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework. It supports three generator
architectures spanning four versions of development:

- **RNN (GRU/LSTM):** Sequential SMILES generation with exploitation-exploration strategy
- **SMILES-based Transformer:** Attention-based generation with BRICS/RECAP fragmentation
- **Graph-based Transformer:** Enables scaffold-constrained generation — sample molecules
  containing specific substructures

Multi-objective optimization uses Pareto-based RL to simultaneously optimize multiple
properties (activity, selectivity, ADMET, novelty) without collapsing them into a single
scalar reward.

## Pretrained Models

Available on Zenodo for multiple architectures and datasets:

| Dataset | RNN (GRU) | RNN (LSTM) | SMILES Transformer | Graph Transformer |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ChEMBL 27 | — | yes | — | yes |
| ChEMBL 31 | yes | yes | — | yes |
| Papyrus 05.5 | yes | yes | yes (BRICS/RECAP) | yes (BRICS/RECAP) |

## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/CDDLeiden/DrugEx.git@master
# With QSAR model support
pip install "drugex[qsprpred] @ git+https://github.com/CDDLeiden/DrugEx.git@master"
```

Requires CUDA-compatible GPU with ≥8 GB VRAM for full model suite. Multiple GPUs
recommended for transformer models.
