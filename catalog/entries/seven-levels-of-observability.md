summary: "A content creator's seven-stage observability maturity ladder — logs, metrics, traces, correlation (shared request ID across logs/traces), alerts, SLOs (SLI/SLO/SLA), and cardinality management — presented as a progression where each stage answers a question the previous one couldn't (what happened, is it trending, where is the time going, why, before users notice, is the target at risk, can we afford to measure it). Not a single named industry-standard framework: published observability maturity models elsewhere range from 3 pillars (logs/metrics/traces) to 4-5 level maturity scales (e.g. Last9, codefarm.in) covering the same underlying concepts — structured logs with trace IDs, OpenTelemetry-style distributed tracing, SLO/error-budget-driven alerting, and cardinality limits on metric labels — under different level counts and names."

## What it says

A seven-stage mental model for observability maturity, framed as each stage letting you see more of a running system than the last:

1. **Logs** — the app writes a line per event, giving you what happened and when; a single line can't show a trend.
2. **Metrics** — numbers reported periodically (request count, error rate, latency) plotted on a dashboard reveal trends (e.g. checkout getting slower), but not which of several services is responsible.
3. **Traces** — following one request through every service and timing each step shows *where* time is spent (e.g. "the database took 800ms"), but not *why*.
4. **Correlation** — stamping every request with an ID at ingress and attaching that ID to every log line and trace span lets you search by ID and get the *why* (e.g. "a database query with no index").
5. **Alerts** — automated watching of metrics (e.g. "errors above 5% for 5 minutes") replaces waiting for user complaints.
6. **SLOs** — SLI (what you measure) vs. SLO (your internal target, e.g. 99.9%) vs. SLA (your promise to customers); alerting shifts from "every blip" to "page only when the target itself is at risk."
7. **Cardinality** — framed as the hardest problem: adding a high-cardinality label (e.g. user ID) to a metric multiplies the number of stored time series, so metric labels should stay low-cardinality and per-user detail should live in logs/traces instead.

Closing framing: "Observability isn't more data. It's the right data." Recommended starting point given: map critical user journeys, instrument logs/metrics/traces sharing one correlation ID, set SLOs, build dashboards, alert on what matters, iterate.

## Context

This specific "7 levels" framing and ordering appears to be the creator's own synthesis rather than a citation of one established, named industry framework. Published observability maturity models cover the same underlying concepts under different level counts: the "three pillars" framing (logs, metrics, traces) is the most common baseline, and multi-level maturity scales from sources like Last9 and codefarm.in range from 4 to 5 levels (e.g. siloed tools → trace-ID correlation → unified data model → SLO-driven → predictive/proactive), covering the same ground as levels 1-6 here (structured logging, OpenTelemetry-style tracing, SLO/error-budget alerting) under different groupings. The cardinality-cost warning (level 7 here) is a standard, widely-documented operational concern in metrics systems (e.g. Prometheus/Datadog high-cardinality-label cost blowups), not specific to this framing.

Tools named in the reel only as parenthetical examples per level (Grafana Loki, Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Alertmanager, PagerDuty, Datadog) are widely known, separately-documented products; the reel does not make any claim about them beyond which observability category they exemplify.
