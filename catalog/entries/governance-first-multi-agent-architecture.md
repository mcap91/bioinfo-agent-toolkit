## What it does

An architecture pattern for solo-use multi-agent systems built governance-first: the oversight rules, delegation boundaries, and approval gates are defined before any agent capabilities. The design uses a four-tier hierarchy rather than a peer-to-peer agent mesh.

**Tier 0 — Lead Agent (Master Control):** Intakes every request, classifies by objective/priority/risk, delegates to the appropriate specialist, and is the only agent that reports back to the user. Enforces approval gates.

**Tier 1 — Specialist Sub-Agents (least-privilege):** Research/analysis operates read-only with no side effects. Ops/comms handles scheduling and message drafting but cannot send. Build/technical stays sandboxed to its own environment with no access to other agents' tools or data.

**Tier 2 — Audit/Watcher (independent):** Cross-checks agent actions against policy and flags problems directly to the user. Cannot be edited, delayed, or silenced by the lead agent. Has no task-execution role — oversight only.

**Tier 3 — Owner (human):** Final sign-off on anything irreversible. The only tier that can approve remediation after the watcher flags an issue.

## Mechanical details

- **Approval gates:** Actions that leave the system (external sends), cost money, delete data, or touch credentials stop and wait for human approval. No agent can self-approve.
- **Least-privilege enforcement:** Each agent receives only the tools and data access its role requires. The deny list overrides the allow list.
- **Watcher independence:** The auditor's communication channel to the human is architecturally separate from the lead agent's control path — the lead cannot intercept, edit, or suppress its reports.
- **Design principle:** Governance as system policy rather than per-workflow annotation. Compared to LangGraph's human-in-the-loop checkpoints, the gates are structural (always enforced) rather than opt-in per graph node.
- **Implemented on:** OpenClaw framework, though the pattern is framework-agnostic.

## Security

The architecture is designed around security: least-privilege access, independent oversight, and hard gates on irreversible actions. The watcher's independence from the lead agent is the critical security property — if compromised (e.g., by allowing the lead agent to suppress watcher reports), the entire governance model collapses. The pattern assumes the human owner reviews watcher flags promptly; unattended operation without flag review re-introduces the risks the gates are meant to prevent.
