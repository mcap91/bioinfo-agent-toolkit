## What it does

A terminal-based network scanner and diagnostic tool written in Rust using Ratatui for the TUI and libpnet for packet capture. Provides multiple network inspection capabilities in a single interface:

- **Interface listing**: enumerates hardware network interfaces, allows switching active interface for scanning and packet dumping.
- **WiFi scanning**: discovers nearby WiFi networks with signal strength visualization (charts).
- **IPv4 CIDR ping**: scans a subnet range, resolving hostname, OUI vendor, and MAC address for each discovered host.
- **Packet dump**: captures and displays TCP, UDP, ICMP, ARP (IPv4) and ICMP6 (IPv6) packets with start/pause control and log filtering.
- **Port scanning**: TCP open port scanning against discovered hosts.
- **Traffic counting**: tracks traffic volume with DNS record resolution.
- **CSV export**: exports scanned IPs, ports, and packets to CSV files (default path: user's `$HOME` directory).

## Installation

Available via `cargo install netscanner`, Arch Linux (`pacman -S netscanner`), and Alpine edge (`apk add netscanner`). On Windows, requires Npcap for packet capture (otherwise `packet.dll` error). Must be run with root/sudo privileges. Post-install, the binary can optionally be given setuid permissions (`chown root:user` + `chmod u+s`) to avoid running the shell as root. ~1.8k GitHub stars, 36k+ crates.io downloads across 28 versions, latest v0.6.43 (July 2026).

## Mechanical details

Built on Ratatui (TUI framework) and libpnet (cross-platform packet capture). ~5,700 lines of Rust across 34 files. Demo recordings use VHS tapes. 13 contributors.

## Security

MIT licensed. Requires root privileges for packet capture — the primary security consideration. On Linux, can use setuid bit to limit root exposure. On Windows, depends on Npcap (third-party packet capture library). The tool performs passive and active network scanning, which should only be used on networks the operator controls or has authorization to scan.
