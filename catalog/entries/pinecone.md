summary: Fully managed, closed-source serverless vector database — proprietary Rust engine separates compute from storage, consumption-based pricing (~$0.33/GB-month storage plus metered read/write units), targets ~200ms query latency at 80% p95 recall; offers hosted embedding/reranking (Pinecone Inference), Pinecone Assistant, Dedicated Read Nodes, and Bring-Your-Own-Cloud for data residency; no self-hosting option.

## What it does

A fully managed vector database for similarity search and RAG retrieval, sold exclusively as a cloud service. Serverless is now the default and effectively only architecture for new projects — pod-based indexes are legacy and unavailable to accounts created after August 18, 2025. Compute and storage scale independently, so there's no pod sizing, rebalancing, or idle compute cost. Built on a proprietary Rust engine; AWS/GCP/Azure-hosted, with Bring-Your-Own-Cloud (BYOC) available for enterprise customers who need the data plane inside their own cloud account.

Beyond core vector storage and query, Pinecone ships adjacent managed features: Pinecone Inference (hosted embedding and reranking models), Pinecone Assistant (production chat/agent app layer), Dedicated Read Nodes for read-heavy workloads, and native full-text search (public preview).

**Pricing (2026):** four tiers — Starter (free: 2GB storage, 2M write units, 1M read units/month), Builder ($20/month flat), Standard ($50/month minimum usage), Enterprise ($500/month minimum). Paid usage bills storage (~$0.33/GB-month) plus metered read and write units separately from storage; namespace-heavy query patterns can push costs well above the headline minimums (one analysis found a namespace-heavy workload exceeding $1,100/month on Standard versus ~$50/month for a consolidated query pattern on the same data volume).

**Deployment model:** closed-source and fully managed only — there is no downloadable or self-hostable version of Pinecone.

## Security

Closed-source, proprietary; no self-hosting option, so adoption means trusting Pinecone's cloud infrastructure and access controls entirely (BYOC narrows but does not eliminate this for enterprise customers). No independent code audit possible since the engine is not open-source.
