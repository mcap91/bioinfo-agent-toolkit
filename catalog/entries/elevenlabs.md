## What it does

ElevenLabs is a commercial AI voice platform offering text-to-speech (TTS), voice cloning, and voice-agent APIs. Models adapt intonation, pacing, and emotional tone to textual cues across up to 32 languages (marketing copy cites 90+ languages and 17,500+ voices for the broader voice-generation product). The voice library ships 10,000+ community-shared voices alongside professional voice cloning (highest fidelity, from longer reference audio), instant voice cloning (from 1-2 minutes of reference audio), and text-described voice design.

Core API: `POST /v1/text-to-speech/:voice_id` converts text to audio for a chosen voice; optional parameters include `model_id` (defaults to `eleven_multilingual_v2`, queryable via `GET /v1/models`) and `language_code`. Eleven Realtime is a separate class of speech-to-speech models bundling ASR, voice-activity detection, turn-taking, an LLM, and TTS into one real-time voice agent. Official JS (`@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js`) and Python SDKs exist, plus community integrations (Vercel AI SDK's `@ai-sdk/elevenlabs`, LangChain-style wrappers). Reported usage (r/vibecoding, Oct 2026): used for AI-generated music and voiceover in a Claude-Code-produced marketing video.

## Mechanical details

- Pricing: consumer tiers from $5-$11/mo (Starter/Creator, unlocks instant/professional voice cloning with commercial license) up to Pro ($99), Scale ($299), Business ($990); API metered at roughly $0.30 per 1,000 characters; 2 free regenerations per generation on identical content/params; voice library not available via API on the free tier.
- Enterprise tier adds SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA (with signed agreement), GDPR terms, EU data residency, and an optional Zero Retention Mode — limited to eligible API and per-agent traffic, not browser-UI traffic.
- Closed-source hosted SaaS; no self-hosted option.

## Security

Proprietary/closed-source. Per ElevenLabs' privacy policy, voice-model data is retained up to 3 years after the last interaction, with no published deletion guarantee specifically for a trained voice-clone model once created; raw recordings are deleted per policy, but voice characteristics absorbed into a trained model may persist. Consumer tiers are trained on by default (prospective opt-out available); Enterprise is excluded from training by default. Independent reviews report an active federal biometric-data class action (filed May 2026) and recurring real-world misuse (unauthorized deepfake audio, impersonation), despite ElevenLabs' consent-verification tooling and detection/takedown efforts; several US states carry deepfake-specific legal exposure for unauthorized commercial impersonation.
