## What it does

A persistent memory system for AI agents using SQLite + Chroma vector DB. Automatically captures observations via 5 lifecycle hooks (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, PostToolUse, Stop, SessionEnd), generates semantic summaries, and provides 3-layer progressive disclosure retrieval (search→timeline→full details) to minimize token usage. Runs a worker service on port 37777 with HTTP API and web UI. Provides 4 MCP tools for intelligent memory search. Supports privacy controls via `<private>` tags. 78.1k stars, Apache 2.0, requires Node 18+, Bun, and uv.

## Assessment

We already have two memory layers that cover this space: Claude Code's built-in auto-memory (file-based, per-project, with structured types) and kb wiki (persistent typed records with relationships, search index, and graph). claude-mem's progressive disclosure and vector search are technically interesting, but add significant infrastructure (SQLite + Chroma + Bun + worker service + 5 hooks) for a problem we've already solved. Previously skipped gbrain and Third Brain V5 for similar reasons. The 3-layer retrieval pattern (index→context→full) is a good concept already reflected in our wiki search approach.

## Mechanical details

- Install: `npx claude-mem install`
- Requires: Node 18+, Bun (auto-installed), uv (auto-installed), SQLite 3
- Config: `~/.claude-mem/settings.json` (auto-created)
- Worker: runs on port 37777, provides HTTP API + web UI
- Hooks: 5 lifecycle hooks auto-capture session activity
- Storage: SQLite for observations, Chroma for vector/semantic search

## Security

Licensed under Apache 2.0, a permissive OSI-approved license that allows use in commercial, enterprise, and agentic tool stacks without restriction. No security flags are raised for the license itself.

The tool's risk profile is moderate for adoption purposes. It runs a persistent background worker service (port 37777) that exposes a local HTTP API and web UI, automatically intercepts 5 Claude Code lifecycle hooks, and stores all session observations in a local SQLite database alongside a Chroma vector DB. The hook-based auto-capture means every tool call and session interaction is recorded — users should be aware of what is persisted and use `<private>` tags to exclude sensitive content. The worker port is localhost-only by default, but the running process increases local attack surface. No network exfiltration concerns are documented. An associated third-party Solana token ($CMEM) was created without the author's prior consent (later endorsed); this has no bearing on the software itself but is worth noting for supply-chain awareness.
