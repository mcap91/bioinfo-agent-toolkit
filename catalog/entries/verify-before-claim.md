## What it says

Third Brain V5's verify-before-claim skill enforces that no completion claim is made without fresh verification evidence — a new command run, not a citation of prior output. Includes explicit exit code checking as a discrete step. Produces structured validation reports with confidence scores rather than a binary pass/fail gate. The confidence model is probabilistic (poker psychology: expected value reasoning) rather than binary, enabling claims like "80% confident this pipeline is correct." Also flags claims backed by only a single source as inherently weaker.

## Why this verdict

`superpowers verification-before-completion` covers the core rule ("evidence before assertions always") and uses verification as a gate. The two approaches are functionally equivalent for the common case. The novel contribution from Third Brain V5 is the probabilistic confidence model — useful if the stack ever needs to express partial confidence rather than binary verified/unverified status.

| Aspect | Third Brain V5 | Superpowers |
|---|---|---|
| Core rule | "No completion claims without fresh verification evidence" | "Evidence before assertions always" |
| Fresh evidence | Must run new command, not cite prior output | Must run verification commands |
| Exit code check | Explicit step | Implicit |
| Confidence model | Expected value (poker psychology) — probabilistic, not binary | Binary: verified or not |
| Single-source flagging | Flags claims backed by only one source | No single-source concept |
| Output | Structured validation reports with confidence scores | Verification is a gate, not a document |

## What to adopt

No immediate action. If a future skill or workflow needs probabilistic confidence reporting rather than binary verification, revisit the confidence model from this source. The single-source flagging concept is also worth incorporating if hallucination rates on reference-backed claims become a concern.
