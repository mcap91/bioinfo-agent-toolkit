## What it does

Semgrep is a static analysis tool that matches code against rules written to look like the source code itself, using abstract-syntax-tree (AST) pattern matching rather than plain text/regex matching — a rule like `$X == $X` matches a tautological comparison regardless of variable names or formatting. Supports 30+ languages. Runs as a one-off CLI scan, inside an IDE, as a pre-commit hook on changed files (blocking a commit when a rule matches), or as a CI/CD step; provides SAST (security rules), software composition analysis (SCA), and secrets detection.

## Mechanical details

The open-source Community Edition (CE) engine is LGPL-2.1-licensed; the 3,000+ community rules it ships with are under the separate Semgrep Rules License v1.0 (permits internal business use, bars use in competing products/SaaS). CE's taint analysis is intraprocedural only (per-function); cross-function and cross-file dataflow, custom taint propagators, and the Secrets validators are reserved for the commercial AppSec Platform (20,000+ proprietary rules, 35+ languages). After the platform moved features behind a commercial license, a consortium of application-security companies forked Semgrep 1.100.0 as Opengrep, also under LGPL-2.1, maintaining compatibility with existing Semgrep rules.

## Security

No build step required for most languages — runs against source directly without compiling or executing it. Developed and commercially backed by Semgrep, Inc. No security advisories surfaced against the CE engine itself in this research pass.
