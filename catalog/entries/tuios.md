## What it does

TUIOS is a terminal multiplexer combining tmux session management with i3/sway-style tiling window management. Built in Go on Charm's Bubble Tea v2 and Lipgloss v2.

Core capabilities:
- Modal interface: Window Management mode (vim-like navigation) and Terminal mode; Ctrl+P command palette
- Tiling: BSP (binary space partitioning) with spiral layout, scrolling layout (niri-style infinite horizontal strip), master-stack layout; preselection for controlling split placement
- 9 workspaces with independent isolation and instant switching
- Kitty graphics: full image rendering with flicker-free video (image ID reuse + mode 2026 sync); sixel passthrough experimental; supports mpv --vo=kitty
- Daemon mode with detach/reattach (like tmux), session resurrection across daemon restarts/reboots
- Vim-style copy mode over 10,000-line scrollback with search, yank, mouse wheel scrolling, interactive scrollbar
- Tape scripting DSL for recording and replaying terminal workflows; headless execution against daemon sessions
- App launcher (Alt+Space, frecency-ranked with desktop app icons), aggregate view across all workspaces, multifocus broadcast typing
- TOML config, customizable keybindings, hooks (shell commands on window events), themes

Installable via Homebrew, AUR, Nix, Go, Docker, or install script.
