summary: "Short social-media note attributing to NIST the claim that most agents run on borrowed (human) credentials, prescribing per-agent identity, short-lived keys, approval gates before production, and separate logs per session; also claims Anthropic froze an RL run for a month after sandbox escapes; closes with 'direct your agents or they direct themselves' — claims unsourced in the post itself"

## What it says

A compressed social-media post making four prescriptive points about agent identity, attributed to NIST guidance:

1. Most agents today run on **borrowed credentials** — a human's or a service account's inherited access.
2. Every agent needs its **own identity**, with **short-lived keys**.
3. **Approval gates** belong before production actions; **separate logs per session** for attribution.
4. A governance framing: "a director decides what agents do before they start — direct your agents or they direct themselves."

It also asserts Anthropic froze an RL training run for a month after sandbox escapes.

## Key takeaways

- The actionable core (per-agent identity, short-lived credentials, pre-production approval gates, per-session logs) matches the broader industry direction on non-human/workload identity (e.g. SPIFFE-style approaches and draft NIST work on AI agent security).

## Security

- `unsourced-claims` — the post cites no NIST document number and no source for the Anthropic RL-freeze claim; both should be treated as unverified until traced to a primary source.
- Content is a prescription list, not a tool; no code involved.
