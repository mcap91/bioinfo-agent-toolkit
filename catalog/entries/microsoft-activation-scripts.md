## What it does

Microsoft Activation Scripts (MAS) provides multiple methods for activating Windows and Office products:

- HWID (Hardware ID): permanent Windows 10/11 activation tied to hardware fingerprint; requires internet
- Ohook: permanent Office activation; works offline
- TSforge: permanent activation for Windows, ESU, and Office; mostly offline
- Online KMS: 180-day renewable activation for Windows/Office; lifetime with scheduled renewal task

Primary install: PowerShell one-liner that downloads and executes a script. Also available as a downloadable offline package. Built entirely on batch scripts. Includes utilities for changing Windows/Office editions and checking activation status.

Latest release: v3.12 (July 4, 2026). Hosted on GitHub, Azure DevOps, and self-hosted Git.

## Security

- Remote execution: primary install downloads and executes a script from a remote URL via PowerShell
- Open-source: fully open batch scripts, auditable on GitHub
- The project warns users to verify URLs before executing and to watch for third-party malware disguised as MAS
