## What it does

DuckDB is an in-process analytical SQL database management system designed for fast, reliable, portable, and easy analytical (OLAP) workloads. It provides a rich SQL dialect extending well beyond basic SQL — arbitrary and nested correlated subqueries, window functions, collations, and complex/nested types (arrays, structs, maps) — plus extensions. It runs embedded in the host process with no separate server, available as a standalone CLI and as clients for Python, R, Java, WebAssembly, and more, with deep integrations for packages like pandas and dplyr. Files can be queried directly, e.g. `SELECT * FROM 'myfile.parquet'` or `'myfile.csv'`.

## Mechanical details

- **Install:** see the DuckDB installation page; the Python client is `pip install duckdb`
- **Query files directly:** reference a CSV/Parquet path in the `FROM` clause
- **Build from source:** requires CMake, Python 3, and a C++17 compiler; `make` (release) / `make debug`; `make unit` / `make allunit` for tests

## Security

MIT licensed. DuckDB is an embedded database engine running in-process; it reads/writes local files and, via extensions, can reach remote/cloud data sources using the caller's credentials. No security flags recorded from the observed material.
