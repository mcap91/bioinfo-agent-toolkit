## What it does

Floci provides standalone cloud emulators for four cloud providers, each running as a native binary with no cloud account or authentication required.

Emulators:
- floci (AWS): 119 services on port 4566; drop-in replacement for LocalStack with same port and zero code changes
- floci-az (Azure): 28 services on port 4577; Blob, Queue, Table, Functions, App Config, Key Vault, Event Hubs, Service Bus
- floci-gcp (GCP): 25 services on port 4588; GCS, Pub/Sub, Firestore, Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, GKE
- floci-oci (OCI): 8 services on port 4599; Object Storage, Identity, Queue, Streaming, KMS, Vault, Functions

Performance: 24ms cold start, 13 MiB idle memory. Compiled with GraalVM Mandrel.

Real engines: Lambda runs in real Docker containers, RDS uses real PostgreSQL/MySQL, ElastiCache runs real Redis. Works with every SDK, CLI, Terraform/OpenTofu module, and test runner.

Developer tools: floci-cli (unified CLI) and floci-ui (visual dashboard to browse resources across all providers).

Positioned as a credential-free alternative to LocalStack, which started requiring an auth token in March 2026.
