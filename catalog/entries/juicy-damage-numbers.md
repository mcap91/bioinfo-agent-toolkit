summary: Game-dev technique for upgrading a default floating-damage-number label into "juicy" feedback through a stack of independent, optional tweaks rather than one fix — pick a legible display font (the reel uses Bungee from Google Fonts), pop the number in on spawn instead of just appearing, float it upward as it arrives, fade it out at the end of its lifetime, give each digit an arc-like falling offset instead of a straight rise, scale its size by the damage value so bigger hits read as bigger, shift its color over time based on which action produced it, layer particles and screen shake onto critical hits using the same logic, experimentally stack numbers on very fast multi-hit attacks, and randomize each number's spawn offset so a burst of hits doesn't render as a single overlapping stack. Framed as a menu of optional, independently-applicable steps rather than a required pipeline, and as engine-agnostic (the creator states it applies to any game engine).

## What it does

A checklist of independent visual tweaks for turning a bare floating-damage-number label into "juicy" feedback, demonstrated by upgrading a default implementation (a plain number that appears and disappears with no animation) step by step: (1) choose a legible display font first — the reel uses Bungee from Google Fonts; (2) pop the number in with a scale/spawn animation rather than having it appear instantly; (3) float it upward as it arrives; (4) fade it out once its on-screen lifetime ends; (5) give it an arc-like falling offset per digit/number instead of a straight vertical path; (6) scale its size based on the damage value, so larger hits render larger; (7) shift its color over time based on the action that produced it (e.g. normal hit vs. heal vs. DoT); (8) apply the same particle-and-screen-shake treatment used elsewhere in the game to critical hits specifically; (9) on very fast multi-hit attacks, experiment with stacking numbers rather than showing each individually; (10) randomize each number's spawn offset so a cluster of near-simultaneous hits doesn't render as one illegible overlapping stack. Presented explicitly as an optional menu — "you don't have to follow all or apply all, whichever suits your feel" — and as implementable in any game engine, not tied to one toolchain.
