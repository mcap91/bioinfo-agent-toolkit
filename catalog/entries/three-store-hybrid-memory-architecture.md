## What it covers

A concise architecture pattern arguing that vector embeddings alone fail for AI agent memory
because they handle only one of three distinct retrieval needs.

## The Three Stores

1. **Vector Store** — Fuzzy semantic similarity for broad concept and intent matching.
   Handles questions like "what tools are similar to X" or "find related discussions."

2. **Key-Value Store** — Exact fact retrieval for user IDs, phone numbers, configs, and
   other precise data. Zero embedding hallucination — the value returned is the value stored.

3. **Knowledge Graph** — Multi-hop relationship reasoning connecting people, tools,
   codebases, and concepts. Handles questions like "which team members have worked on
   projects using tool X that also touch system Y."

## Fusion Layer

All three stores run in parallel on every query. A fusion layer ranks and merges results
using:
- Relevance scores from each store
- Importance tags (user-assigned or inferred)
- Recency decay (newer information weighted higher)

## Design Rationale

Vector search alone fails on exact lookups (returns semantically similar but factually wrong
results) and relationship queries (embeddings don't encode graph structure). The pattern
trades infrastructure complexity for query-type coverage.
