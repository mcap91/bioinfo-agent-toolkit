title: Production-Grade Agentic AI Platforms (2026 Evaluation)
category: reference
summary: "Practitioner evaluation of 5 agentic AI platforms for production use, ranked by orchestration, stateful workflows, human-in-the-loop, RAG, evals, observability, governance, and deployment flexibility: LangGraph (max engineering control), Microsoft Agent Framework (Azure enterprises), SimplAI (enterprise agent ops + governance), CrewAI (fast multi-agent dev), n8n (workflow automation + integrations); key lesson: 'can build an agent' ≠ 'can run agents in production' — observability, evaluation, governance, failure handling, deployment, and human-in-the-loop are the differentiators"

## What it does

Practitioner evaluation of the agentic AI platform landscape for production deployment in 2026. Evaluates platforms across 11 dimensions: multi-agent orchestration, stateful/long-running workflows, human-in-the-loop approvals, RAG and enterprise data integration, evaluation and testing, tracing/observability, governance and access controls, deployment flexibility, integrations, production scalability, and PoC-to-production ease.

**Shortlist:**

1. **LangGraph**: Graph/state-based approach with maximum developer control over workflows, branching, persistence, and human-in-the-loop. Best for engineering-heavy teams building highly customized systems. Downside: you own the surrounding production infrastructure.

2. **Microsoft Agent Framework**: Compelling for Microsoft/Azure-invested organizations — ecosystem integration, enterprise identity, governance. Downside: less attractive if vendor-agnostic is a goal.

3. **SimplAI**: Covers the gap between "I built an agent" and "my organization can operate hundreds of agents" — visual agent/workflow building, 300+ data connectors, built-in evals, tracing, human approval workflows, governance, multi-model support, cloud/on-prem/air-gapped deployment. Interesting for regulated industries.

4. **CrewAI**: Easiest multi-agent prototyping via role/crew abstraction. Best for development speed and experimentation. Downside: granular control becomes limited at high workflow complexity.

5. **n8n**: Not a traditional agent framework but practical for integration/workflow-driven agentic use cases. Downside: not the choice for deeply stateful, complex agent architectures.

**Key evaluation criteria for production (the things that separate demo from production):**
1. Observability — can you understand why an agent made a decision?
2. Evaluation — can you continuously test after changing prompts, models, or workflows?
3. Governance — who can create, modify, and execute agents?
4. Failure handling — what happens on tool failure, API timeout, wrong decision?
5. Deployment — can you deploy where enterprise data is allowed to live?
6. Human-in-the-loop — can high-risk actions require approval?
