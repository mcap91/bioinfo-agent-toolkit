## What it is

A step-by-step tutorial (with runnable code) for building an AI agent entirely on free infrastructure. Targets complete beginners — no prior experience assumed. Uses LangChain's `create_agent` + LangGraph with Groq's free Llama 3.3 70B (~14,400 requests/day, no card) as primary model and Google Gemini free tier (1,500 requests/day, 1M context) as fallback.

## What it teaches

1. **First agent.** Minimal `create_agent` with a system prompt — chatbot-level, no tools.
2. **Adding tools.** DuckDuckGo search (prebuilt, no key) + a custom `@tool`-decorated Python function. Demonstrates the plan→act→observe loop.
3. **Memory.** `InMemorySaver` checkpointer + `thread_id` for conversation persistence across turns.
4. **Provider fallback.** try/except pattern that fails over from Groq to Gemini when a provider goes down or rate-limits. Avoids `with_fallbacks()` due to agent compatibility issues.
5. **Complete agent.** Combined version with all four features.

## Key points made

- Free tiers change without warning; never hardcode a single provider.
- Most no-key models train on your prompts — keep sensitive data off them.
- `InMemorySaver` is RAM-only (vanishes on restart); swap for Postgres/Redis for persistence.
- LangGraph leads open-source agent frameworks in enterprise adoption (34.5M downloads/month per Firecrawl's 2026 report).

## Security

Tutorial code only — no installable artifact beyond standard pip packages. Warns users to never commit `.env` files. Explicitly notes the privacy cost of free tiers (prompt training). No sensitive patterns in the example code itself.
