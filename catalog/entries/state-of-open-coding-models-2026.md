title: The State of Open Coding AI Models (August 2026)

category: reference
summary: "Opinion snapshot (Aug 2026) arguing the best open coding models no longer fit regular consumer hardware, so 'open' no longer implies 'local.' Cites Kimi K3 (~2.8T params, ~1.56 TB on HF), GLM 5.2 (the one people called safe to leave running unattended; complaints about verbosity, not wrong answers), and DeepSeek V4 (vendor claims open-source SOTA on agentic coding, but the preview checkpoint felt rough and headline numbers came from the vendor's own agent harness). Thesis: the interesting engineering has shifted from training these models to serving them faster/cheaper. Author discloses a bias (works for a GPU cloud provider)."

## What it says

A discussion/article revisiting a year-old take that non-engineers should just run open-source AI locally for free. The author's updated claim: open coding models are now genuinely good for real work (including "vibecoding") but have grown so large that they no longer fit on regular consumer hardware — so "open" no longer has to mean "local." Self-disclosed bias: the author works for a GPU cloud provider (i.e. inclined toward "more compute").

## Observations reported

- **Kimi K3** (July 2026): ~2.8 trillion parameters, ~1.56 TB on Hugging Face — used to argue the "open ≠ local" point.
- **GLM 5.2:** the only model people described as "safe to leave running unattended"; complaints were about verbosity, not wrong answers.
- **DeepSeek V4:** vendor claims "open-source SOTA on agentic coding," but the preview checkpoint felt rough in practice, and most headline numbers came from the vendor's own agent harness.
- **Thesis:** the interesting engineering has shifted from *training* these models to *serving* them faster and more efficiently.

## Notes

- This is a point-in-time opinion piece, not a benchmark; model claims are attributed to vendors/community and are not independently verified here. Treat specifics as a mid-2026 snapshot that will age.
