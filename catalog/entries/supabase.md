## What it does

Supabase is an open-source Firebase alternative built on Postgres and enterprise-grade open source tools. It provides a complete backend platform:

- **Database**: Full Postgres with realtime functionality, backups, and extensions
- **Auth**: Email/password, passwordless, OAuth, and mobile logins via GoTrue (JWT-based)
- **Auto-generated APIs**: REST (PostgREST), GraphQL (pg_graphql), Realtime subscriptions (Elixir websocket server)
- **Edge Functions**: Globally distributed server-side functions (Deno)
- **Storage**: S3-backed file storage with Postgres-managed Row Level Security permissions
- **AI + Vector toolkit**: pgvector integration for embeddings and vector similarity search
- **Dashboard**: Web UI for database management

Architecture is modular — each component is a standalone open-source project: Postgres, PostgREST (REST), GoTrue (auth), Realtime (Elixir), Kong (API gateway), pg_graphql, postgres-meta. Client libraries mirror this: each sub-library is standalone for a single system.

Official SDKs: JavaScript/TypeScript, Flutter/Dart, Swift, Python. Community SDKs: C#, Go, Java, Kotlin, Ruby, Rust, Godot. Migration paths from Amazon RDS, Auth0, Firebase, Heroku, MySQL, Neon, and others.

Self-hostable or use the hosted platform. AI-first development supported via MCP, plugins, and skills.

## Assessment

Relevant as backend infrastructure for bioinformatics web tools and data applications. The Postgres foundation means standard SQL for genomic data, with pgvector for embedding-based similarity search on literature or sequence representations. Row Level Security handles multi-tenant access control for shared datasets. Realtime subscriptions could power live analysis dashboards.

The platform approach (auth + storage + API + database in one) reduces the integration surface for building data-sharing portals or analysis result browsers. Edge Functions handle compute-near-user for lightweight transformations.

Not a bioinformatics tool per se, but strong infrastructure for building bioinformatics applications — especially ones that need auth, file storage (for BAMs, FASTQs), and a queryable database in one stack.

## Mechanical details

- **Self-host**: Docker Compose setup available
- **Hosted**: Free tier available, paid plans scale
