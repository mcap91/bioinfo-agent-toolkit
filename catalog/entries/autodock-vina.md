## What it does

AutoDock Vina predicts how small molecules (ligands) bind to protein targets by searching
for the lowest-energy binding pose within a defined search space. It uses a simple empirical
scoring function combined with rapid gradient-based optimization and iterated local search
for conformational sampling.

Key capabilities:

- **Docking:** Predict binding poses and affinities for protein-ligand complexes
- **Virtual screening:** Batch mode processes compound libraries against a target
- **Multi-ligand docking:** Simultaneously dock multiple ligands
- **Macrocycle support:** Handle ring systems larger than typical drug-like molecules
- **Hydrated docking:** Protocol accounting for explicit water molecules
- **External maps:** Read and write AutoDock grid maps for custom scoring
- **Dual scoring:** Both AutoDock4.2 and Vina scoring functions available

## Python API

Python 3 bindings available on Linux and Mac for programmatic docking workflows.

## Installation

See documentation at readthedocs.org for platform-specific instructions.
