## What it does

Chandra OCR 2 is a vision-language model for document parsing that converts images and PDFs
into structured output while preserving layout information.

Strengths:

- **Math:** Equations, handwritten math, non-Latin math notation
- **Tables:** Statistical, financial, and complex multi-column tables
- **Forms:** Checkboxes, registration forms, leases
- **Handwriting:** Cursive writing, handwritten notes
- **Multilingual:** 90+ languages; 77.8% average accuracy across 43 common languages
  (vs 67.6% Gemini 2.5 Flash, 60.5% GPT-5 Mini)
- **Images:** Extracts diagrams/images and adds captions with structured data

## Output Formats

- Markdown (`.md`)
- HTML (`.html`)
- JSON metadata (page info, token counts)

## Usage

```bash
pip install chandra-ocr

# vLLM server (recommended for production)
chandra_vllm
chandra input.pdf ./output --method vllm

# Local HuggingFace inference
pip install chandra-ocr[hf]
chandra input.pdf ./output --method hf

# Interactive app
pip install chandra-ocr[app]
