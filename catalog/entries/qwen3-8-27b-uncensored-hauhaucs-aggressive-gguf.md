## What it does

This is a GGUF-format redistribution of Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B (dense 27B causal LM with vision encoder, 64 layers, 262,144-token native context) produced by Hugging Face contributor "HauhauCS," modified with an "uncensoring" post-processing profile the publisher calls "Aggressive." The publisher states the release makes "no changes to datasets or intended capabilities" beyond applying this uncensoring profile, and preserves Qwen3.8's native NextN/MTP (multi-token-prediction) head. The publisher also markets a "HauhauCS FastMTP" acceleration sidecar — a compact draft model plus a required llama.cpp source patch — claimed to speed up token generation (TG) versus both no-MTP and Qwen's standard embedded MTP, at "identical output" to the un-accelerated target model (verified via output-hash matching in the publisher's own reported tests).

Multiple GGUF quantization levels are provided (Q2_K_P through Q8_K_P, plus IQ2/IQ3/IQ4 variants), including publisher-defined "K_P" ("Perfect") quants said to use per-model analysis to selectively preserve quality. A separate BF16 vision projector file (`mmproj-...-BF16.gguf`) is required for image/video input. A "Balanced" (less aggressive) uncensoring variant is referenced as existing "if one is available" for reliability-sensitive agentic use, but is not the artifact at this URL.

## Differentiators / Key takeaways

- Explicitly and intentionally removes refusal behavior from the base model rather than being an incidental side effect of quantization.
- Bundles a from-scratch speculative-decoding acceleration path ("FastMTP") distinct from and layered on top of Qwen3.8's own built-in MTP head, requiring a custom llama.cpp patch to use.
- Publisher provides a self-signed authenticity scheme (Ed25519-signed release manifest + per-file SHA-256 and "canonical tensor fingerprint") to detect tampering/renaming of files — this proves file integrity against HauhauCS's own signature, not third-party trustworthiness of the content.
- Part of a large catalog of similarly-branded "Uncensored-HauhauCS" releases across many base model families (Qwen, GPT-OSS, Gemma, etc.), per third-party reporting.

## Mechanical details

- Base model: Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B (Apache-2.0), 64 language-model layers, hidden size 5,120, FFN size 17,408, 248,320-token vocabulary, 48 Gated DeltaNet + 16 gated-attention layers, native 262,144-token context (extensible to 1,000,000 with framework-specific config).
- Quant files range from Q2_K_P (3.12 BPW, 10.68 GB) to Q8_K_P (9.21 BPW, 31.46 GB); IQ2_M/IQ3_M/IQ3_XS/IQ4_XS variants also provided.
- FastMTP sidecar file: `Qwen3.8-27B-Uncensored-HauhauCS-Aggressive-FastMTP-32K.gguf` (903 MB), used with `--spec-type draft-mtp` on a patched llama.cpp build (patch applied via `git apply` against a pinned commit).
- Compatible with llama.cpp and GGUF-compatible runtimes (LM Studio, Jan, KoboldCpp) at base level; FastMTP requires the patch and rebuild.
- Recommended sampling settings mirror the official Qwen3.8 model card (thinking mode: temp 1.0/top_p 0.95/top_k 20; instruct mode: temp 0.7/top_p 0.80, presence_penalty 1.5).
- License: publisher states the release "retains" Qwen3.8-27B's Apache-2.0 license from Qwen.

## Security

- **License**: Apache-2.0 (inherited from Qwen3.8-27B per publisher statement; not independently verified against Qwen's actual license grant for derivative/modified weights).
- **Safety posture**: Deliberately removes refusal/safety behavior from the base model ("uncensored," "Aggressive" profile) — this is the artifact's stated purpose, not an incidental flaw.
- **Supply chain**: Published by a pseudonymous individual contributor (HauhauCS, associated with Reddit account u/hauhau901 per third-party reporting), not an organization or the original model vendor; authenticity is self-attested via a publisher-controlled Ed25519 key, not a third-party CA or the base model publisher.
- **Benchmark provenance**: "0/465 Refusals" and FastMTP speed-up figures (e.g., "3.02x document TG") are publisher-reported; independent third-party testing of other releases in this same publisher's lineup found partial refusal leakage under adversarial testing despite zero-refusal marketing claims.
- **Build risk**: FastMTP requires cloning llama.cpp, checking out a pinned commit, and applying a third-party `.patch` file before compiling — this executes third-party source-code changes into a locally built binary; review the patch contents before applying.

## Usage notes

- **Community data point — Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-Uncensored (orcarouter)**: IQ4_XS quant running at 22 tok/s on desktop hardware (128GB RAM, 32GB VRAM), fully in memory. Reported as "uncensored to the point that it's a bit concerning" — suggesting aggressive abliteration in this variant.
