## What it does

EmbeddingGemma 2 maps five modalities — text, code, images, video, and audio — into a single 768-dimensional embedding space. Built on the Gemma 4 architecture, released by Google DeepMind on 2026-10-06.

Modular design loads only what is needed:

- **Text + code** (270M params): 130M transformer + 140M embedder. 191MB RAM on Pixel 11 Pro.
- **Text + vision** (440M params): adds 170M vision encoder.
- **Text + audio** (570M params): adds 300M audio encoder.
- **Full multimodal** (740M params): all encoders. ~0.5GB RAM.

Context window: 8,192 tokens (4x EmbeddingGemma 1). Fits ~29 images, 58 video frames, or 5.5 minutes of audio per input.

All configurations share one vector space — a text-only query matches documents embedded by the full model.

## Mechanical details

Output dimension: 768, reducible to 512, 256, or 128 via Matryoshka truncation.
