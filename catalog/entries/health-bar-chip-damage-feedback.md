summary: Game-dev UI/feedback techniques for making hit-point damage feel satisfying without changing the underlying numbers. Health bar — on damage, a pale/orange "chip" trail is left behind at the bar's prior fill level and holds briefly before draining down to the new value (rather than snapping instantly), so the player sees how much was lost; the bar also shakes, flashes, and punches on each hit; its color shifts green→yellow→red as a threshold-based danger signal; healing fills back in smoothly with a sparkle effect at the fill edge. Floating damage numbers — numbers pop in, float upward, and fade out over roughly half a second to just over a second; rapid consecutive hits stack and arc to alternating sides so overlapping numbers stay legible; number size scales with hit magnitude; numbers are color-coded by type (e.g. white/normal, orange/critical, green/heal); critical hits render bold and with extra shake. Presented as a reusable feedback layer independent of the underlying damage math — the same damage value reads as more or less impactful purely from how it is animated and rendered.

## What it does

Two paired feedback layers for hit-point damage, both decoupled from the actual damage value:

**Health bar.** Instead of the fill snapping instantly to the new value on a hit, a pale/orange "chip" segment is left behind at the bar's prior level, holds for a beat, then drains down to the new value — this trailing segment is what lets the player register how much was lost on a fast hit, not just the end state. The bar also shakes, flashes, and "punches" on every hit as an immediate impact cue, and its overall color shifts on thresholds (green → yellow → red) as a secondary, at-a-glance danger signal independent of the exact number. Healing is handled as the inverse: the fill rises smoothly rather than jumping, with a sparkle effect at the moving edge.

**Floating damage numbers.** Each hit spawns a number that pops in, floats upward, and fades out over roughly half a second to a bit over a second. Rapid consecutive hits stack their numbers and arc them to alternating sides so overlapping hits stay individually readable instead of stacking illegibly in place. Number size scales with the hit's magnitude (small hit → small glyph, big hit → big glyph), and color encodes hit type (e.g. white for normal, orange for critical, green for healing); critical hits additionally render bold and with extra shake for emphasis.

Both layers are framed as cosmetic feedback on top of an unchanged damage/health model — the same underlying value change can read as weak or punishing purely from how the bar and numbers animate it.

## Usage notes

- Independent reel's implementation detail for the drain: on a hit, reduce the bar's displayed fill to the lowest value reached in any single frame (a min-clamp), then lerp the displayed fill toward the true value scaled by delta time for the smooth drain-down, rather than snapping it instantly (source: https://www.instagram.com/reel/DamtFQYxYtn/)
- Same reel: floating damage numbers are positioned at the "last dealt" point by computing the same lerp-time value that drives the bar's drain and using it to offset/modulate the number's position, rather than spawning the number at a fixed anchor (source: https://www.instagram.com/reel/DamtFQYxYtn/)
