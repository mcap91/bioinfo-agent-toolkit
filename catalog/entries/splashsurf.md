## What it does

splashsurf reconstructs a continuous triangle-mesh surface from raw SPH (smoothed particle hydrodynamics) particle data. Simulators like [[splishsplash]] output only particle positions each timestep, which look like loose sand/grains rather than a liquid; splashsurf fits a smooth surface around the particle cloud so it can be rendered as a fluid. It reads particle data formats including `.bgeo` and `.vtk` and writes mesh output for import into renderers or 3D tools (e.g. Mitsuba, Blender, Maya).

## Mechanical details

Written in Rust, distributed as both a library and a command-line binary. 309 GitHub stars, 29 forks, MIT licensed, maintained by Fabian Löschner under the Interactive Computer Graphics organization (the same group that maintains [[splishsplash]]). Users on SPlisHSPlasH's own GitHub discussions recommend it as the standard next step after simulation, noting the raw reconstruction can look bumpy and benefits from smoothing before import into a DCC tool. In the demonstrated pipeline (SPlisHSPlasH → splashsurf → Mitsuba), splashsurf is the middle, mesh-reconstruction stage between simulating 71,346 particles and rendering the final water footage.

## Security

MIT licensed. Offline Rust CLI/library — reads local particle files and writes local mesh files, no network calls or telemetry observed in its stated function. Standard build-from-source/crates.io trust model.
