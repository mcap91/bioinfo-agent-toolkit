## What it does

Qwen Code is a terminal AI coding agent forked from Google's Gemini CLI and re-tuned for Qwen3-Coder models, with an enhanced parser and tool-call support for that model family. It asks for permission before modifying files by default, makes Git operations conversational (e.g. "what files have I changed?"), reads project files as needed instead of requiring manual context attachment, and automatically switches to a vision-capable model when it detects images in the input. Install via `npm install -g @qwen-code/qwen-code`, `brew install qwen-code`, or from source. The recommended auth method, Qwen OAuth, is free with generous quotas. The QwenLM org also ships `qwen-code-action` (a GitHub Action wrapper) and `open-computer-use` (an MCP-based computer-use service controlling macOS/Linux/Windows via accessibility APIs).

## Security

Apache-2.0. Default file-edit confirmation prompt is a built-in control. On Terminal-Bench, Qwen Code paired with Qwen3-Coder-480A35 scored 37.5 — a vendor/community-reported benchmark figure, not independently reproduced here.

## Usage notes

- Practitioner report (r/Qwen_AI, Oct 2026): used as the CLI harness (with Zed as editor and a SearXNG MCP server for web research) for self-hosted Qwen 3.8 27B, run at xhigh reasoning effort via vLLM on a single 48GB NVIDIA L40S.
