## What it does

/brag is an agent skill that turns a software project into a short launch video. It analyzes the project, crafts a product narrative (angle, tone, key moments), then hands a focused brief to Hyperframes for video rendering with music, motion, and timing.

Usage: run /brag inside any project. Optional flags:
- --tone to steer the narrative style
- --voice to enable AI voiceover via Kokoro through Hyperframes (off by default)

Output: brag-output/ folder with the plan, composition brief, share copy, and rendered brag.mp4.

Installation:
- Claude Code: plugin marketplace add, then plugin install
- Other agents (Cursor, Codex, Copilot, Gemini CLI, opencode): npx skills add with the repo URL
- Manual: copy skills/brag/ to ~/.claude/skills/brag/

Cross-agent discovery via symlinks for Claude Code, Codex CLI, and opencode. Requirements: Node.js 22+, FFmpeg on PATH, Hyperframes CLI.
