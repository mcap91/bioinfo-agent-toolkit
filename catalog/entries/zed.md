## What it does

Zed is a code editor with a native Agent Panel: Zed's own built-in agent can read, write, and run code in a project, and the editor also hosts third-party coding agents (Claude, Codex, OpenCode, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Qwen Code) through the Agent Client Protocol (ACP) — Zed renders the conversation/thread UI while the external agent process owns its own runtime and tool execution. Other editor features include inline edit predictions and multiplayer collaborative editing.

## Security

Editor core is open source (GPL-3.0/Apache-2.0 mix across the codebase); AI add-ons (Zed-hosted model access, org admin layer) are a paid tier on top of the open core. External agents connected via ACP run in their own process and retain their own permission model — Zed does not describe ACP as adding a sandbox around them.

## Usage notes

- Practitioner report (r/Qwen_AI, Oct 2026): used as the editor in a self-optimized harness for self-hosted Qwen 3.8 27B — Zed + Qwen Code + a SearXNG MCP server, run at xhigh reasoning effort.
