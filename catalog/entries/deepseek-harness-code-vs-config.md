summary: "Explainer of the DeepSeek Harness design shift as described by Stephen G. Pope — instead of defining an agent's tools, prompts, model, and loop in application code (requiring rebuild/redeploy to change), the harness moves that behavior into configuration the running system can hot-reload, letting a coding agent modify its own behavior and create/adjust tools without a release process; characterized as early but notable for agent builders"

## What it says

Most coding agents share one loop: send the model a message with a system prompt and tool registry, then keep passing conversation history and tool results back through the LLM. The **DeepSeek Harness** shift, per Stephen G. Pope's explanation, is "code versus config": rather than defining the agent's tools, prompts, model selection, and loop mostly inside application code, the harness moves that behavior into **configuration the running system can reload**.

The consequence: changing code means rebuild and redeploy; changing config lets an AI coding agent modify how it behaves — create or adjust tools, change prompts — and keep working without a release process.

## Key takeaways

- Config-reloadable behavior is what makes agent *self-modification* operationally cheap; the boundary between "the agent's program" and "the agent's settings" becomes the real architecture decision.
- The post positions this as early-stage but significant for agent builders.

## Security

- Second-hand explainer of a vendor design; no primary documentation cited in the content.
- Note the implicit risk it does not discuss: an agent that can rewrite its own tool/prompt config without a release process also bypasses the review gate a release process provides.
