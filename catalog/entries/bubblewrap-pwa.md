## What it does

Bubblewrap (Google Chrome Labs) is a CLI and library for packaging Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) as Android applications that launch via Trusted Web Activity (TWA). Not related to the containers/bubblewrap Linux sandboxing tool despite the same name.

Components:
- **@aspect/core**: JavaScript library for generating, building, and updating TWA projects
- **@aspect/cli**: Command-line interface
- **@aspect/validator**: Validates and compares TWA projects against quality criteria

Powers PWABuilder for generating APKs from PWAs.

## Assessment

Unrelated to agent/sandboxing workflows. Useful if building mobile-accessible bioinformatics dashboards as PWAs and wanting native Android distribution via TWA. Very specific use case with no agent or developer-tool relevance.

## Mechanical details

Requires Node.js 14.15.0+. Community contributions welcome; monthly public office hours.
