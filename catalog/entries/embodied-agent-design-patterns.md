## What it does

Reports four design lessons from putting an agent with persistent memory and tool access into a physical robot:

1. **Reflexes must bypass the agent completely.** Anything routed through a model call feels dead/laggy in a physical, real-time context. Example: waving back at a person is implemented as a ~300ms reflex handled entirely by on-device vision, never going through the LLM.

2. **Memory accumulates contradictions.** After weeks of continuous operation, memory files built up redundant and conflicting facts. Mitigation: a periodic consolidation job hands the accumulated memory to a stronger model for reconciliation. Memory entries are recommended to carry an audit trail — source, last-confirmed timestamp, and an invalidation method — rather than being flat unattributed facts.

3. **Tool restraint, not tool capability, is the constraint.** An agent given 38 tools reached for the wrong one constantly. The lesson stated directly: capability isn't the limiting factor on agent quality — restraint is. Tool access should be explicitly restricted to what's needed for the task at hand rather than exposing everything by default.

4. **Timing beats intelligence for perceived quality.** Body/gesture actions are fired from tags placed inline within the model's output sentence, so a gesture lands on the exact word it relates to rather than firing only after the full sentence completes. This fine-grained timing is reported to have done more for the robot's perceived intelligence than any underlying model upgrade.

## Differentiators / Key takeaways

The reflex-bypass and timing points both point to the same underlying idea: for real-time/physical interaction, routing everything through an LLM call introduces latency that reads as "dead" regardless of model quality — some behaviors need to live outside the model loop entirely, and others need fine-grained synchronization with model output rather than post-hoc triggering.

## Mechanical details / What to adopt

- Route latency-sensitive reactive behaviors (reflexes) through dedicated on-device logic, not the agent loop
- Add a scheduled memory-consolidation pass using a stronger model, with source/timestamp/invalidation metadata on stored facts
- Default to a minimal tool set per task rather than a large always-available toolbox
- Emit action/gesture tags inline within generated text rather than as a separate post-processing pass, to preserve word-level timing
