## What it does

Yarn Spinner is a dialogue system for writing interactive, branching conversations in Yarn, a simple screenplay-like markup language, then running them inside a game. At runtime the Yarn Spinner engine sends the host game lines of dialogue to display, options for the player to choose between, and commands that trigger in-scene behavior (e.g. playing an animation or setting a game-state flag) as the conversation plays out. The core compiler/runtime is engine-agnostic (C#); `YarnSpinner-Unity` is the official Unity integration package wiring that runtime into Unity's UI and scene systems.

## Mechanical details

Developed by Secret Lab with community contributions and support from NYU Game Center. 845 GitHub stars / 129 forks on the Unity integration repo (the core `YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner` compiler repo is separate). Distributed via the Unity Asset Store, an Itch.io store page, or Package Manager git-URL install. Version 3.x introduced "Dialogue Presenters," a new model for how dialogue/options are shown on screen, replacing the deprecated presentation code from 2.x. Used in shipped commercial games including Night in the Woods, A Short Hike, Lost in Random, Dredge, Frog Detective, Button City, Escape Academy, Baladins, and Unbeatable.

## Security

MIT licensed. Local scripting/dialogue runtime with no network calls or telemetry — it only reads authored Yarn scripts and drives in-game UI/events.
