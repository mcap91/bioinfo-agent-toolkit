## What it does

A Claude Code plugin that analyzes a codebase with a multi-agent pipeline (5-7 specialized agents), builds a knowledge graph of every file, function, class, and dependency, then provides an interactive web dashboard for exploration. Uses a tree-sitter + LLM hybrid approach: tree-sitter for deterministic structural parsing (imports, exports, call sites, inheritance), LLM for semantic analysis (summaries, architectural layer assignment, business-domain mapping, guided tours).

Key features: interactive force-directed graph visualization, fuzzy and semantic search, diff impact analysis (see which parts your changes affect), guided architecture tours ordered by dependency, persona-adaptive UI (junior dev / PM / power user), architectural layer visualization (API/Service/Data/UI/Utility), business domain extraction, and Karpathy-pattern wiki knowledge graph analysis. Supports incremental updates — only re-analyzes changed files. Graph output is JSON, committable for team sharing.

## Assessment

The tree-sitter + LLM hybrid is a sound architecture — deterministic structural edges with semantic annotations. The multi-platform support (17+ platforms) and interactive dashboard are polished. The wiki knowledge graph feature (`/understand-knowledge`) is directly relevant to our Karpathy-pattern wiki. However, watch rather than pilot because: (1) the multi-agent pipeline is token-heavy — 5+ agents analyzing every file, with batches of 20-30 files and up to 5 concurrent analyzers, could be expensive on large repos, (2) the graph output at scale (10MB+ requiring git-lfs) suggests significant data volume, (3) we already have kb-wiki for wiki-based retrieval and would need to evaluate whether the knowledge graph adds enough value over our existing structured wiki, and (4) the project is relatively new and the installer pipes curl to bash, which warrants caution.

## Mechanical details

- Claude Code install: `/plugin marketplace add Egonex-AI/Understand-Anything` then `/plugin install understand-anything`
- Core command: `/understand` — runs the multi-agent analysis pipeline
- Dashboard: `/understand-dashboard` — opens interactive web visualization
- Additional commands: `/understand-chat`, `/understand-diff`, `/understand-explain`, `/understand-onboard`, `/understand-domain`, `/understand-knowledge`
- Incremental by default — fingerprint-based change detection via tree-sitter
- Auto-update mode: `/understand --auto-update` installs a post-commit hook
- Localization: `--language` flag supports en, zh, zh-TW, ja, ko, ru
- Graph stored in `.understand-anything/knowledge-graph.json` — committable JSON
- Multi-agent pipeline: project-scanner, file-analyzer (parallel, 5 concurrent), architecture-analyzer, tour-builder, graph-reviewer, domain-analyzer, article-analyzer
- File analyzers: up to 5 concurrent, 20-30 files per batch
- Tests: `pnpm --filter @understand-anything/core test`

## Security

- **License**: MIT
- **Dependency health**: Uses tree-sitter for parsing (well-maintained); dashboard is web-based. pnpm workspace structure suggests a Node.js monorepo
- **Code quality signals**: Tests exist (`pnpm test`); contributing guide present; issue-first policy for major changes
- **Supply chain**: Created by Yuxiang Lin / Egonex (Infinite Universe, Inc.); installer scripts pipe curl to bash (standard but worth auditing)
- **Dangerous patterns**: The install script (`curl | bash`) downloads and executes code — review before running. The multi-agent pipeline runs LLM analysis on your codebase — standard risk of code content being sent to the model provider. No eval() or injection concerns visible from the README
- **Maintenance**: Active development; broad platform support indicates ongoing maintenance; community engagement via YouTube walkthroughs
