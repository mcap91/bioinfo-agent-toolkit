summary: Game-dev technique for making a playable card feel satisfying instead of flat, via five layered effects applied on top of an otherwise unchanged card-in-hand interaction — (1) hover, where sliding across the hand pops each card up and leans it toward the cursor, though grabbing one barely lifts it off the table; (2) pick up, where lifting a card high spreads its shadow outward beneath it, though the card stays visually flat while dragged; (3) sway, where the card leans in the direction it's dragged and swings back when released, though it originally teleported into place on drop; (4) snap, where the card flies into its target slot, overshoots, and settles, with the rest of the hand sliding over to close the gap, though this step is silent; (5) sound, adding a soft flick noise on grab and a slap noise on landing. Framed as a reusable five-layer pipeline — the same baseline card-in-hand interaction (described as "about as fun as filling in a form") reads as a satisfying "big play" purely from how many of these layers are stacked on top of it, independent of the card game's actual rules or content.

## What it does

A five-step layered presentation pipeline for a card-in-hand interaction, contrasted against a plain baseline (a card that can be dragged and dropped with no animation, described as feeling like "filling in a form"). The steps, each built on top of the last: (1) hover — sliding the cursor across the hand pops each card up and leans it toward the cursor, though at this stage grabbing a card barely lifts it off the table; (2) pick up — lifting a card high spreads its shadow outward beneath it to sell the height, though the card itself stays visually flat while being dragged around; (3) sway — the card leans in the direction it's being dragged and swings back when drag stops, though releasing it still teleports it straight into place; (4) snap — on release the card flies into its target slot, overshoots past it, and settles back, while the rest of the hand slides over to close the gap left behind, though this motion is silent; (5) sound — a soft flick sound plays on grab and a slap sound plays on landing, completing the stack. Presented as a reusable five-layer pipeline: the same underlying drag-and-drop interaction reads as flat and unengaging or as a satisfying "big play" purely from how many of these layers are applied on top of it, independent of the card game's actual rules or card content.
