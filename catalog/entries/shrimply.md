## What it does

Shrimply is a cross-platform video editor written in Rust. Currently pre-alpha.

Tech stack:
- **Interface**: GTK 4 + libadwaita
- **Rendering**: Skia, wgpu, Slang, CUDA
- **Media**: FFmpeg, PipeWire
- **Compute**: Python server

Requirements: NVIDIA or Apple Silicon GPU, Wayland or macOS 15+.

Pre-alpha status means expected issues: build difficulties, undocumented footguns, performance regressions, project file breakage, crashes and resource leaks.

## Security

- **License**: GPL-3.0-or-later (core); NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit, OptiX SDK, Optical Flow SDK, Video Codec SDK retain their own proprietary license terms
- **Pre-alpha**: not production-ready
