## What it says

Free 10-week, 20-lesson data science curriculum from Microsoft Azure Cloud Advocates. Covers:

1. **Introduction** (lessons 1-4): Defining DS, ethics, data classification, statistics & probability
2. **Working with Data** (5-8): Relational/SQL, NoSQL, Python/Pandas, data preparation
3. **Visualization** (9-13): Quantities, distributions, proportions, relationships, meaningful viz (all Matplotlib)
4. **Lifecycle** (14-16): DS lifecycle, analysis techniques, communication
5. **Cloud** (17-19): Azure ML Studio, low-code training, model deployment
6. **In the Wild** (20): Real-world DS projects

Each lesson includes pre/post quizzes, written instructions, solutions, assignments, and optional sketchnotes/videos. Beginner-friendly examples directory with commented code. Supports GitHub Codespaces and VS Code dev containers.

## Assessment

Solid foundational DS curriculum — well-structured, project-based, and free. The Python/pandas/Matplotlib stack is standard for bioinformatics data exploration. More introductory than Zero to Mastery ML (which covers sklearn/TensorFlow) — this is genuinely for beginners. Azure-cloud lessons (17-19) are vendor-specific but skippable.

Useful as an onboarding resource for someone entering computational biology who needs DS fundamentals before tackling domain-specific tools.

## Mechanical details

- **Access**: Clone repo or use GitHub Codespaces; offline via Docsify
- **Prerequisites**: Basic Python recommended for lesson 7+
- **Quiz app**: 40 quizzes, 3 questions each, can run locally or deploy to Azure
- **Sparse checkout**: Available to skip 50+ translation directories (significantly reduces clone size)

## Security

- **License**: MIT — no restrictions
- **Supply chain**: Microsoft-maintained, multiple named authors, active community contributions
- **No code execution risk**: Educational content, no installable dependencies beyond standard Python DS stack
