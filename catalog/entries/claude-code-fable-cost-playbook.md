## What it is

A practitioner-compiled cost-optimization guide for running Claude Fable 5 (priced at $10/M input, $50/M output) inside Claude Code without runaway bills. Covers six techniques that compose together.

## Techniques

1. **Effort-level tuning.** `\effort low` reduces output token generation by ~80% with negligible quality loss on coding benchmarks (Anthropic's own data shows low-effort Fable outperforms max-effort Opus on code tasks).

2. **Subagent model tiering.** Define `.claude/agents/<role>.md` files with `model: claude-haiku-4-5` or `model: claude-sonnet-5` frontmatter. Cheap agents handle discovery, file scanning, and mechanical work; Fable preserves its budget for judgment-heavy steps.

3. **Hard budget capping.** Session-level spend limits shut down runaway recursive loops before they burn hundreds of dollars overnight.

4. **Prompt-cache preservation.** Keeping sessions alive (no clear/restart) lets repeated context reads hit the 90%-discounted cached-prefix path ($1/M vs $10/M input).

5. **The advisor alternative.** Run a cheaper model (Sonnet 5, Opus 4.8) as the primary executor; switch to Fable only for architectural/strategic prompts that benefit from its reasoning depth.

6. **Avoid "Max" / "Ultra Code" effort settings.** These trigger deeply nested reasoning chains at $50/M output with diminishing returns over low-effort on most coding tasks.

## Security

No installable artifact. Describes CLI configuration and workflow patterns only. Primary risk is billing exposure from misconfigured effort or unbounded subagent loops — mitigated by technique 3 (budget caps).

## Usage notes

- Anthropic first-party benchmarks (July 2026): Fable 5 orchestrator + Sonnet 5 workers = 96% of all-Fable performance at 46% cost. The orchestrator split outperforms the advisor split on both accuracy and cost.
- The built-in Explore subagent inherits the main-session model since v2.1.198 — if running Fable/Opus, background searches bill at that tier. Shadow it with a user-level `~/.claude/agents/Explore.md` pinned to `model: haiku` to reclaim savings.
- Community prompt for workflow-based orchestration: "Setup a workflow using Sonnet 5 agents for low-level tasks, delegate synthesis/reviews to Opus 4.8 agents, finalize with Fable 5 review."
