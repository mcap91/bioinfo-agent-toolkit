## What it does

Databasement is a self-hosted web application for managing database backups across 8 database engines (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, SQL Server, MongoDB, SQLite, Firebird, Redis/Valkey).

Key features:
- Automated backups on daily/weekly schedules with simple time-based or GFS (grandfather-father-son) retention policies
- Compression: gzip, zstd (20-40% better compression), or AES-256 encryption
- Storage targets: local disk, S3-compatible (AWS S3, MinIO), Azure Blob Storage, Samba/SMB, SFTP/FTP
- SSH tunnels for databases in private networks through bastion/jump servers
- Remote agents: lightweight agent connects out over HTTPS from firewalled networks, dumps locally, uploads to storage
- Cross-server restore: restore snapshots from production to staging or between compatible servers
- Scheduled restores: recurring prod-to-staging refreshes replaying the latest completed snapshot
- Built-in Adminer data browser for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite (admin-enabled, role-gated)
- Multi-tenant organizations with RBAC, OAuth/SSO (Google, GitHub, GitLab, OIDC), optional 2FA
- Notifications: Email, Slack, Discord, Telegram, Pushover, Gotify, Webhook
- REST API and MCP server for scripting, CI/CD, and AI assistant integration

Deployment: single Docker container with built-in web server, queue worker, and scheduler. Also supports Docker Compose, Kubernetes (Helm), and native Ubuntu.
