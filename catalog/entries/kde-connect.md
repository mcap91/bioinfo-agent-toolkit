## What it does

KDE Connect pairs a phone and a computer over the same local Wi-Fi network so they can exchange data directly, without an account, a cloud relay, or a vendor server in the middle. Once paired, it provides a shared clipboard (copy on one device, paste on the other), instant file and link transfer, notification sync with the ability to read/reply to Android notifications and SMS from the desktop, remote control of Linux media players, a virtual touchpad/keyboard mode, a presentation-remote mode, running shell commands on the computer from the phone, and browsing the phone's filesystem from the computer over SFTP.

The project originates from KDE and targets Plasma/Linux as the primary platform; the Android app is the reference mobile client. Non-KDE desktop environments get KDE Connect's protocol through separate client implementations: GSConnect for GNOME Shell, Valent for GTK4/libadwaita desktops, Soduto for macOS, and Konnect as a headless server.

## Differentiators

- Fully local/offline operation: devices communicate directly over LAN (or via a self-hosted relay for remote use), so no third party handles clipboard or file data.
- Broad plugin surface beyond clipboard/file sync — SMS, run-commands, media control, touchpad/keyboard, presentation remote, find-my-phone — in one pairing.
- Cross-desktop ecosystem of independent client implementations (GSConnect, Valent, Soduto) built on the same open KDE Connect protocol.

## Mechanical details

- Desktop: official builds for Linux (native KDE package), Windows (Microsoft Store or `.exe` installer from kdeconnect.kde.org), and macOS (`brew install --cask kde-connect`, or nightly builds).
- Mobile: Android app on Google Play/F-Droid; a native iOS app exists but exposes a reduced feature set due to Apple platform restrictions.
- Pairing happens automatically for devices on the same Wi-Fi network; no account creation or sign-in step.
- License: GPL-2.0-or-later / GPL-3.0 (dual-licensed across the codebase); maintained under the KDE project (`KDE/kdeconnect-kde` on GitHub, ~4.1k stars).

## Security

- **License:** GPLv2/GPLv3 — copyleft, standard for KDE projects.
- No cloud account or server dependency for core operation reduces third-party data exposure; traffic stays on the local network unless a relay is configured.
- Remote-command execution and SMS access plugins mean a compromised or maliciously paired device has a meaningful control surface over the other device — pairing confirmation is the main safeguard, so it should only be accepted for trusted devices on a trusted network.
- No CVE history reviewed as part of this entry; not independently audited here.
