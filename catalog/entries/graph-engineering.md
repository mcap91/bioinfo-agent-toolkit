## What it does

Graph engineering is the practice of designing and operating multi-agent AI systems as explicit directed graphs where nodes are heterogeneous (agents, deterministic functions, routers, joins, tools, human checkpoints) and edges represent control flow, data dependencies, and delegation rules. The topology itself is treated as a programmable, versionable artifact rather than an emergent result of prompt engineering.

Core principles:

- **Deterministic backbone**: The overall flow is orchestrated by deterministic logic (Python code, state machines, workflow engines). LLM intelligence is deployed only at specific nodes where reasoning is needed. Control returns to the backbone after each LLM step.
- **Evolutionary progression**: Start with one agent → add a retry/reflection loop → split into specialists (researcher, builder, reviewer) → connect them with a graph where the workflow, not the prompt, decides who runs next based on state, results, or failures.
- **Typed edges**: Edges encode routing conditions — implemented as deterministic Python logic or LLM classifiers. The engineering discipline lives in the edges, not the nodes.
- **Declarative structure**: A graph requires declaring the structure upfront — who owns what, what depends on what, what happens when a branch fails — unlike single-agent loops where architecture is deferred.

The pattern reflects Anthropic's own engineering guidance: the "winning approach" is a deterministic backbone orchestrating the flow, with agents invoked intentionally at specific steps.

## Assessment

Graph engineering is a framing/paradigm, not a specific tool. Key implementations include LangGraph (LangChain's StateGraph with typed nodes and conditional edges), Microsoft AutoGen's GraphFlow, and Temporal for enterprise-durable workflows. The concept is also central to Claude Code's Workflow tool, which uses deterministic JavaScript to orchestrate agent() calls with pipeline()/parallel() combinators.

The framing remains contested and evolving as of mid-2026. The term consolidates ideas from multiple sources: Andrew Ng's agentic design patterns, Anthropic's building effective agents guide, and academic work on multi-agent workflow representation (e.g., AgentCo-op's directed graph G=(V,E) formalization).

## Security

Not applicable — this is an architectural pattern, not executable code. Security implications depend on the implementing framework.
