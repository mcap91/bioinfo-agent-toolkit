## What it says

Announces three Claude Code features, shipped alongside Claude Code Web (claude.ai/code):

- **`/ultraplan` (beta)** — sends a planning task to Claude Code on the web for browser-based plan review with inline comments; the reviewed plan can then be executed remotely or sent back to the CLI for local execution.
- **`/powerup`** — an interactive, in-product way to discover Claude Code features through short lessons with demos.
- **`/insights`** — generates reports analyzing a user's Claude Code sessions, covering project areas touched, interaction patterns, and points of friction.

## Differentiators / Key takeaways

This is a narrow, announcement-level entry covering only these three specific commands/features. A separate, more comprehensive Claude Code commands reference (sourced from code.claude.com/docs/en/commands) is tracked separately in this catalog's intake pipeline and was not yet a written entry at the time this item was cataloged; that entry, once written, is the more complete reference for the full CLI command surface. This entry exists to capture the `/ultraplan`, `/powerup`, and `/insights` features specifically, including their web-based/beta framing, which a general commands reference may or may not cover in the same depth.

## Mechanical details

`/ultraplan` is explicitly marked beta and is the only one of the three with a CLI-to-web-and-back round trip (plan review happens on claude.ai/code, execution can happen either remotely or back in the CLI).

## Security

Reference/announcement content — no code shipped, no security concerns.
