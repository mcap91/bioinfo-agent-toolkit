## What it does

LlamaIndex is an open-source Python framework for building LLM applications over private data. It provides data connectors to ingest sources and formats (APIs, PDFs, docs, SQL), ways to structure data as indices and graphs, and a retrieval/query interface that returns knowledge-augmented output for a given prompt. A high-level API can ingest and query data in a few lines; lower-level APIs allow customizing connectors, indices, retrievers, query engines, and rerankers. It integrates with outer frameworks (LangChain, Flask, Docker, and others).

The library is namespaced: `llama-index` is a starter package bundling core plus common integrations, while `llama-index-core` installs core alone for pairing with any of 300+ integration packages on LlamaHub. LlamaParse/Parse is the company's separate commercial platform for agentic OCR, parsing, extraction, and indexing (130+ formats), usable with the framework or standalone.

## Mechanical details

- **Install:** `pip install llama-index` (starter) or `pip install llama-index-core` plus chosen integration packages (e.g. `llama-index-llms-openai`, `llama-index-embeddings-huggingface`, `llama-index-llms-ollama`)
- **Minimal RAG:** `SimpleDirectoryReader(...).load_data()` → `VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(...)` → `index.as_query_engine().query(...)`; persist with `index.storage_context.persist()`
- `llama-index-core` ships an `_static` folder (nltk/tiktoken caches) whose build provenance is verifiable via GitHub `attest-build-provenance` / `gh attestation verify`

## Security

MIT licensed. LlamaIndex orchestrates calls to third-party LLM/embedding/vector-store providers using credentials the caller supplies (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`); those integrations make outbound API calls. The 300+ optional integration packages are a broad dependency surface — install only what an application needs. Build assets in `llama-index-core/_static` can be verified against the repo via GitHub build-provenance attestations. No security flags recorded from the observed material.
