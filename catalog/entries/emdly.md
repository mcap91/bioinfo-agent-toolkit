## What it does

emdly is a curated marketplace for SKILL.md files — structured instruction files for AI coding agents. It provides discovery, comparison, and one-command installation of skills across domains.

Key capabilities:

- **Curated marketplace**: Skills are human-reviewed and pre-screened in a sandboxed AI environment for safety before publishing.
- **CLI installer**: `npx @emdly/cli add <publisher>/<skill>` installs any skill. Compatible with Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, and other agents that support the SKILL.md format.
- **Public GitHub sync**: The full collection is synced to a public `emdly-stack` GitHub repo, so skills aren't locked inside the platform.
- **Publisher namespacing**: Skills are addressed as `publisher/skill-name` (e.g., `kernelpanic/pr-review-ritual`, `sevzero/incident-postmortem`).

**Notable skills in the catalog:**
- `querydeck/sql-query-explainer` — explains SQL queries in plain language, flags missing indexes
- `shopmetric/ga4-funnel-analyst` — finds checkout funnel drop-offs by step, device, source
- `pixelforge/playtest-feedback-triage` — sorts playtest notes into balance, UX, bugs, feel
- `sevzero/incident-postmortem` — drafts blameless postmortems from timeline + channel export
- `kernelpanic/pr-review-ritual` — structured code review discipline for agents
- `sevzero/k8s-incident-triage` — ranks probable causes from kubectl output, read-only commands only
- `shiplog/changelog-composer` — turns merged PRs into human-readable changelogs
- `promptsmith/skill-author-guide` — how to write skills that pass emdly review

## Security

License unclear — not documented on the site. Skills are human-reviewed and sandboxed before publishing. The public GitHub sync provides transparency into published content. Individual skills should be reviewed before installation as with any third-party code.
