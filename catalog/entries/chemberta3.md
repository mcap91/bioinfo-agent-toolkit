## What it does

ChemBERTa-3 is a training and benchmarking framework for chemical foundation models. It
provides a unified pipeline to pretrain, fine-tune, and evaluate multiple model architectures
on molecular property prediction tasks.

Supported model architectures:

- **Transformer models:** ChemBERTa (masked language modeling on SMILES), MoLFormer
- **Graph pretraining models:** GROVER, InfoGraph, Infomax3D
- **Baseline supervised models:** GCN, D-MPNN, Random Forest

Pretraining datasets scale from 250K SMILES (graph models) up to 1.4B compounds from ZINC20
and PubChem. The largest pretrained MoLFormer variant (c3-MoLFormer-1.1B) trains on 100%
ZINC20 + 100% PubChem.

## Benchmarking

Fine-tuning and evaluation use MoleculeNet datasets with scaffold splits:

- **Classification:** BACE, BBBP, ClinTox, HIV, Tox21, SIDER (ROC-AUC)
- **Regression:** ESOL, BACE_R, Lipophilicity, FreeSolv, Clearance (RMSE)

Supports both DeepChem scaffold splits and MoLFormer-paper splits for reproducibility.
Triplicate runs reported with ranges.

## Featurizers

CircularFingerprint (ECFP), MolGraphConv, RDKit 3D conformers, GROVER graph features,
D-MPNN atom/bond features, and a dummy passthrough for SMILES-native models.

## Pretrained Models

Available on HuggingFace at `DeepChem` organization:

| Model | Pretrained On |
|---|---|
| c3-MoLFormer-1.1B | 100% ZINC20 + 100% PubChem |
| c3-MoLFormer-550M | 50% ZINC20 + 50% PubChem |
| c3-MoLFormer-100M | 10% ZINC20 |
| ChemBERTa-MLM-100M | 10% ZINC20 |
| ChemBERTa-MLM-10M | 1% ZINC20 |
