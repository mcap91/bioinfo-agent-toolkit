summary: "Game-dev architecture technique for sharing behavior across many entity types without duplicating code or using deep inheritance chains: break each behavior into a small, self-contained node (e.g. a health component that stores health, subtracts damage, and fires a signal when it reaches zero; a hit-detection component; a damage-on-touch component; a death-drop component), each of which knows nothing about the specific enemy it's attached to. A new enemy is assembled by dropping in the needed components, wiring their signals, and tuning numbers — only animation work is enemy-specific. Improving a shared component improves every entity using it at once. This is Godot's established community pattern of composition over inheritance via nodes and signals, not a technique unique to one project; demonstrated in a dev-log reel where 76 enemies in the roguelike Capy of Gods (built in Godot) run on the same shared health component."

## What it does

A game-architecture technique for sharing behavior across many entity types in Godot without deep inheritance chains, by decomposing behavior into small, self-contained node components that know nothing about the entity they're attached to. Each component does one job:

- **Health component**: stores max health, subtracts incoming damage, and fires a signal when health reaches zero.
- **Hit-detection component**: an area/hitbox that detects an incoming attack and passes the damage amount to the health component.
- **Damage-on-touch component**: deals damage when the entity's body touches another.
- **Death-drop component**: spawns experience (or other rewards) when the entity dies.

Components communicate by emitting and connecting to each other's signals rather than holding direct references or knowledge of the parent entity, so a component written for one enemy works unmodified on any other. A new enemy is built by dropping the needed components into a scene, wiring their signals together (e.g. connecting the hit-detection component's output to the health component's damage input), and tuning exported numeric values (max health, damage amount, drop amount); the only enemy-specific work left is animation. Because every enemy that uses a component shares the same script, fixing or improving one component improves every entity built from it simultaneously.

This is Godot's broader, established "composition over inheritance" community pattern (built around Godot's node tree and signal system), not a technique unique to one project. Community implementations of the same idea include reusable HealthComponent node libraries and C#/GDScript composition frameworks for Godot. Demonstrated in a dev-log reel for Capy of Gods, a Chilean solo-developed vertical-climbing roguelike built in Godot, where the same health component is shared across 76 of the game's enemies.
