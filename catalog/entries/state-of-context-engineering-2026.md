category: reference
summary: "Redis-published survey report on context-engineering maturity among IT/AI infrastructure leaders: defines context engineering as deciding what an agent sees at each step (navigable, fresh, fast, compounding); reports 79% call context 'very important' yet 81% sit at the two earliest maturity stages (ad hoc/exploratory) and only 4% report reaching the 'compounding' stage; cites Gartner ('context engineering is in, prompt engineering is out', July 2025) and Cognizant's plan to train/deploy 1,000 context engineers (Aug 2025); promotes Redis's own Iris product and a gated 'Context Engineering Maturity Model' self-assessment/full report."

## What it says

A Redis-published report on "context engineering" — the practice of deciding what an AI agent should see at each step of a task (which facts/records/past interactions, from which systems) and delivering it in a navigable, fresh, fast, and compounding form. Based on a survey of IT and AI infrastructure leaders (sample size/methodology not stated on the fetched page). Central framing: model quality is no longer the bottleneck for production agents — context is.

It cites external validation for the category forming: Gartner telling AI leaders in July 2025 that "context engineering is in, and prompt engineering is out"; Cognizant announcing (Aug 2025) plans to train and deploy 1,000 "context engineers"; and Anthropic donating MCP (introduced Nov 2024) to the Agentic AI Foundation under the Linux Foundation in Dec 2025.

## Key statistics reported

- 79% call context "very important" to AI/data goals; 18% "somewhat important."
- 81% sit at the two earliest maturity stages (43% ad hoc, 38% exploratory); 58% are at Stage 1 or 2 overall.
- 94% say "compounding system intelligence" is essential for production-grade maturity; only 4% report having reached it.
- 73% agree agents fail more often from broken context than broken models; 83% say fresh context matters more than more model parameters.
- 69% find agents unreliable at navigating relationships across systems; 69% say navigation failure creates more operational risk than hallucination (rising to 97% among the most mature organizations).
- 55% lack a reliable semantic data model; 47% lack a well-defined context graph; 54% report siloed vector stores limit agent effectiveness.
- 37% name governance tooling the single biggest barrier to production maturity; 60% rate themselves ineffective at governing AI context access, while 58% are simultaneously confident their systems are governed effectively.
- 84% monitor context-system SLOs inconsistently; 78% capture decision traces inconsistently.
- Among the most mature ("compounding") organizations: 54% have a well-defined context graph, only 12% perceive significant latency risk (vs. 92% among ad hoc organizations) — but even these organizations report 69% still rely on stale data for some critical decisions.

## Notes

- Vendor-sponsored research: published by Redis, promotes Redis Iris ("connects memory, live data, and retrieval in one place") inline mid-report, and funnels readers to a gated self-assessment and a downloadable full report.
- Survey methodology (respondent count, company sizes, sampling method) is not disclosed in the fetched page content.
- Companion asset referenced: "The Context Engineering Maturity Model" (five-stage self-assessment framework), not itself fetched as part of this entry.
