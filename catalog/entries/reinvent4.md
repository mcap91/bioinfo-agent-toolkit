## What it does

REINVENT 4 generates optimized small molecules compliant with a user-defined multi-component
property profile. The core loop uses reinforcement learning to steer generative models (RNN
and transformer architectures operating on SMILES strings) toward desired molecular properties.

Supported design modes:

- **De novo design:** Generate novel molecules from scratch matching a property profile
- **Scaffold hopping:** Replace a molecular scaffold while preserving activity-relevant features
- **R-group replacement:** Explore substitutions at defined positions on a scaffold
- **Linker design:** Generate molecular linkers connecting two fragments (e.g., for PROTACs)
- **Molecule optimization:** Iteratively improve an existing molecule's properties
- **Library design:** Generate focused compound libraries

Transfer learning pre-trains or fine-tunes models toward a target chemical space. Curriculum
learning stages objectives progressively during RL.

## Architecture

- **Generators:** Recurrent neural networks (Reinvent, LibInvent, LinkInvent) and transformers
  (Mol2Mol) for different design tasks, unified under one framework
- **Scoring:** Plugin-based scoring subsystem using Python namespace packages — custom scorers
  drop into `reinvent_plugins/components/` without modifying core code
- **Configuration:** TOML (primary), JSON, or YAML config files specify run mode, model,
  scoring components, and parameters
- **Prior models:** Pre-trained models hosted on Zenodo; internal priors referenced via dot notation

## Installation

```bash
conda create --name reinvent4 python=3.11
conda activate reinvent4
git clone git@github.com:MolecularAI/REINVENT4.git
cd REINVENT4
python install.py cu126  # or rocm6.4, xpu, mac, cpu
```

Also supports `uv sync` for faster setup.
