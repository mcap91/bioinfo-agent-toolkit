## What it says

Birgitta Böckeler's article on martinfowler.com frames AI agent architecture as Agent = Model + Harness, where the harness is everything except the model itself — the control system that makes model output trustworthy.

The harness taxonomy has two orthogonal dimensions:

**Control direction:**
- **Guides (feedforward)**: Rules that steer the agent before it acts (system prompts, CLAUDE.md rules, templates)
- **Sensors (feedback)**: Checks that verify after the agent acts and enable self-correction (tests, linters, type checkers)

Both are needed: feedback-only means the agent keeps repeating the same mistakes; feedforward-only means you never find out if your rules work.

**Control type:**
- **Computational**: Deterministic and fast — tests, linters, type checkers
- **Inferential**: Semantic, done by an LLM — slower and non-deterministic but understands meaning

**Three regulation levels:**
1. **Maintainability** (code quality) — easiest to regulate
2. **Architecture fitness** (architectural rules via fitness functions) — medium difficulty
3. **Behavior** (functional correctness) — hardest, still largely unsolved; current approaches rely on AI-generated tests + manual checking

## Key takeaways

- The model is still the brain; the harness directs human attention to where it matters instead of everywhere
- Computational controls (tests, linters) are the foundation — fast, deterministic, reliable
- Inferential controls (LLM-based review) fill semantic gaps but are non-deterministic
- Functional correctness verification remains the hardest unsolved problem in agent engineering
- The taxonomy (feedforward/feedback × computational/inferential × three levels) provides a structured way to audit harness coverage
