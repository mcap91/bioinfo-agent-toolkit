## What it does

Milvus is a high-performance, cloud-native vector database designed for billion-scale similarity search. Written in Go and C++ with hardware acceleration. Under the Linux Foundation AI and Data, with Zilliz as primary contributor.

Core capabilities:

- **Distributed architecture**: Separates compute and storage, horizontally scalable on Kubernetes with independent query and data nodes
- **Index types**: HNSW, IVF, FLAT, SCANN, DiskANN, GPU-accelerated CAGRA (NVIDIA cuVS)
- **Hybrid search**: Dense vectors + sparse vectors (SPLADE, BGE-M3) + native BM25 full-text search, fused via configurable reranking
- **Lake-native access (v3.0)**: Index vectors directly in S3/GCS/ADLS using Apache Iceberg, Parquet, Lance, or Vortex — no ETL required
- **External collections**: Define searchable indexes over data in object storage
- **Snapshots**: Point-in-time read-only views for evaluation and validation
- **Multi-tenancy**: Isolation at database, collection, partition, or partition-key level
- **Hot/cold storage**: Frequently accessed data in memory/SSD, cold data on cheaper storage
- **Milvus Lite**: Embedded variant via `pip install pymilvus`, stores to local file

Client libraries: Python, Java, Go, Node.js, C#, RESTful API. 44k+ GitHub stars.
