## What it does

Kafka-compatible data streaming platform written in C++ instead of Java. Single-binary deployment bundles broker, schema registry, HTTP proxy, and Raft consensus — eliminates ZooKeeper/KRaft, JVM, and separate schema registry dependencies. Natively supports the Kafka API, so existing Kafka clients and tooling work without changes.

**Key components:**
- **Redpanda Streaming** — the core broker with built-in schema registry, tiered storage, and continuous partition balancing
- **Redpanda Connect** — 300+ data, CDC, and AI connectors (stateless), replacing Kafka Connect
- **Redpanda Console** — open-source UI that also works with Apache Kafka

## Differentiators

- **Single binary** — no ZooKeeper, no JVM, no separate schema registry or HTTP proxy
- **C++ engine** — claims 10x lower average latencies vs Kafka, 3-6x cost efficiency
- **Dynamic topic optimization** — optimize topics for availability, consistency, latency, safety, and networking costs at runtime
- **Tiered Storage** — production-proven; Cloud Topics (direct-to-object-storage) GA early 2026
- **300+ connectors** including AI connectors (Kafka Connect has ~200+, no AI)
- **Built-in monitoring** via Prometheus (no third-party tools required)

## Mechanical details / What to adopt

- Deploy as single binary or via Redpanda Cloud (BYOC or dedicated)
- Kafka API compatible — existing producers/consumers work unchanged
- 24/7/365 enterprise support available
