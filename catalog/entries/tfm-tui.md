## What it does

tfm is a terminal file manager designed around mouse interaction rather than keyboard-only workflows. Runs inside a terminal emulator but provides GUI-like features: click to select, rubber-band selection, right-click context menus, inline rename, and drag-and-drop between folders.

Key features:
- Dual pane with independent tabs, path bar, sort, and search per side
- Places sidebar with GTK bookmarks, recent files, XDG trash with restore, clipboard
- Image/video thumbnails via kitty graphics protocol (kitty, ghostty, WezTerm, Konsole); falls back to Nerd Font glyphs
- Network locations: sftp://, smb://, WebDAV, FTP via gvfs with in-app credential prompts
- Embedded terminal (right-click → Open Terminal Here)
- Archive extract and compress via right-click menu
- Auto-hide panes: sidebar/preview/terminal collapse to edges and slide back on mouse hover
- TypeScript plugins in ~/.config/tfm/plugins/ with hot reload, custom commands/keybinds, context menus, previews, event hooks, and UI slots

Cross-app drag-and-drop requires kitty. Linux only. Configuration via TOML at ~/.config/tfm/config.toml.
