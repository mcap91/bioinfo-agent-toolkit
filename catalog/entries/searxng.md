## What it does

SearXNG aggregates results from dozens of external search engines and services (up to ~251 configurable sources) into one interface without tracking users, storing queries, building profiles, or showing ads. It is server-side software meant to be self-hosted (official Docker image `searxng/searxng`), though public community-run instances also exist. `!bang` shortcuts target a single underlying engine, and administrators can select which engines to query and tune ranking/display behavior.

## Security

AGPL-3.0. Self-hosting keeps all query data under the operator's control; public instances rely on the instance operator's own privacy practices, which SearXNG itself does not enforce beyond not tracking by design.

## Usage notes

- Practitioner report (r/Qwen_AI, Oct 2026): backs an MCP server used for web research in a Zed + Qwen Code harness for self-hosted Qwen 3.8 27B; described as far more effective than Opus 4.8's basic HTTP fetch for that purpose.
