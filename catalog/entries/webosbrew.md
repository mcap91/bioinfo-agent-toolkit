summary: Community hub for rooting LG webOS Smart TVs — hosts the Homebrew Channel (a sideloaded on-device app store/manager unlocking apps like Kodi and Moonlight, ambient-light integrations such as HyperHDR, screensaver/wallpaper changes and remote-button remapping once installed), a directory of current software root exploits tracked per webOS version and patch date (faultmanager, DejaVuln, WTA, crashd, RootMy.TV, GetMeNow, plus a hardware DEBUG-flag method), and a model/firmware compatibility checker (CanI.RootMy.TV).

## What it does

webosbrew.org is the community hub for rooting LG webOS Smart TVs. It hosts the "Homebrew Channel," a sideloaded on-device app/channel that, once installed via a software root exploit, acts as an app store and manager (installs homebrew apps like Kodi and Moonlight, exposes a Dev Manager) and unlocks features LG's own stock Developer Mode does not expose: ambient-light setups (PicCap/Hyperion/HyperHDR), screensaver/wallpaper changes, and remote-control button remapping. The rooting page lists current methods by webOS version and patch status: faultmanager (webOS 4.0+ including webOS 9, unpatched as of January 2025), DejaVuln (webOS 3.5+, being patched per model), WTA (patched in a recent update), crashd (patched April 2024), RootMy.TV (worked on webOS 3–6, patched 2022), GetMeNow (worked on webOS 1–3, stopped working after early-2024 Dev Mode app updates), and NVM, a hardware DEBUG-flag modification requiring opening the TV. A companion site, CanI.RootMy.TV, checks compatibility by model and firmware.

## Key takeaways

- Rooted vs. Dev Mode trade-off, per the site's own comparison table: rooting removes the 1,000-hour Dev Mode renewal requirement and unlocks ambient-light/cosmetic/remote-remap features Dev Mode can't reach, but guaranteed firmware updates become Dev Mode's advantage — rooted devices can often still update, but it isn't guaranteed, and an update can silently undo root.
- Each software rooting method targets a specific webOS/firmware version range and gets patched by LG over time; the site's role is tracking which method is still live for a given version rather than offering one universal exploit.
- The hardware method (NVM) is explicitly flagged as requiring the TV to be opened, with a stated risk of fatal electric shock from high-voltage components.

## Security

- The site states software rooting methods are "generally safe... and having no consequences even if it fails," but warns that reckless system changes, independent of the rooting step itself, can brick the TV.
- Software root methods (faultmanager, DejaVuln, WTA, crashd, RootMy.TV, GetMeNow) exploit firmware vulnerabilities that LG patches over time, which is why the directory is version- and date-qualified rather than universal.
- The hardware method requires opening the TV chassis and modifying a DEBUG flag; the site warns of high-voltage components and advises great caution.
- Tools built on top of this rooting layer (see overlapping webOS entries) separately note that Homebrew Channel's telnet access is an unauthenticated root shell open to the whole local network until SSH with a key is enabled and telnet disabled.
- Rooting voids the TV's manufacturer warranty, per the standard disclaimer repeated across tools in this ecosystem.
- No license information was present on the fetched rooting page; not independently verified here.
