## What it says

Practitioner notes from conversations with a large-enterprise CIO and their peer network about semantic layers, ontologies, and agentic systems. Key observations:

**Enterprise state of play:**
- Large enterprises are disproportionately focused on internal agents (reducing talent costs), not customer-facing ones
- They recognize the need for context management but lack the right terminology for it
- Most are pointing agents at fragmented internal systems and hoping the model infers business meaning across them, which breaks quickly in production

**Five core observations:**

1. **Static ontologies are dead on arrival** — the real environment changes daily but semantic models update quarterly; an intelligent system should reorganize its internal understanding continuously, closer to cognition than schema design

2. **The bottleneck is context selection, not data access** — the real question is what context is right for a given decision, what should be ignored, and how fast it can be assembled; humans draw on compressed, evolving, relevance-weighted internal models, and that is the actual design problem

3. **Enterprise semantics is misread in two directions** — some flatten it to metadata/catalog descriptions, others make it too abstract to operationalize; the real need is technical enough for production, dynamic enough to evolve, and grounded enough to encode institutional meaning under latency/security/ownership constraints

4. **Vendor semantics is not organizational semantics** — every platform ships its own semantic layer, but institutional knowledge can't be outsourced to whichever vendor has the best UI this quarter; meaning scattered across vendor-owned surfaces yields local optimizations but never a coherent institutional model

5. **The hard part is representing judgment, not just knowledge** — valuable work is interpreting incomplete information and making calls under ambiguity; the real question is how to build systems that inherit evolving decision context, not just stored facts

**Meta-observation:** the same need gets called ontology, knowledge graph, semantic layer, context graph, company brain, agent memory, or institutional memory — often all in one conversation. That pattern usually means the need is ahead of the label.

## Key takeaways

The author's thesis: "intelligence at work" depends on continuously evolving context more than model quality or data availability. The next real infrastructure layer is whatever can unify fragmented meaning, keep it current, and make it queryable at decision speed without collapsing under latency, trust, or governance constraints.
