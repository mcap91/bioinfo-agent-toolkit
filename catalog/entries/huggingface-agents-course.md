## What it says

A free, multi-unit course from HuggingFace teaching AI agent concepts from first principles. Unit 1 builds a "dummy agent" — a raw Python implementation of the Thought → Action → Observation loop — to demonstrate the mechanics before introducing frameworks. Subsequent units cover smolagents, LangGraph, and LlamaIndex.

The course is deliberately framework-agnostic in its conceptual teaching, using a minimal Python function as a Tool and a HuggingFace Serverless API (InferenceClient) as the LLM backend. Each unit includes runnable notebooks.

## Key takeaways

- Demonstrates the core agent loop: system prompt with tool descriptions → LLM generates Thought + Action JSON → generation stops at "Observation:" token → real tool executes → result injected as Observation → generation resumes.
- Highlights the hallucinated-observation problem: without a stop token, models fabricate tool results. The `stop=["Observation:"]` parameter prevents this.
- Shows that the "agent library" abstraction is primarily system-prompt construction + stop-token management + tool dispatch — demystifies what frameworks do under the hood.
- Uses HuggingFace's Serverless Inference API with `InferenceClient`, providing free model access for experimentation.

## Mechanical details

- **Format:** Multi-unit online course with Jupyter notebooks.
- **LLM backend:** HuggingFace Serverless API via `huggingface_hub.InferenceClient`.
- **Progression:** Dummy agent (raw Python) → smolagents → LangGraph → LlamaIndex.
- **Prerequisites:** Basic Python. No framework installation required for Unit 1.
