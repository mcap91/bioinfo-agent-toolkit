summary: Game-dev terrain-rendering technique that replaces hand-drawn tileset art entirely with a single shader. Each map cell stores one terrain-type number instead of a chosen tile sprite; a shader reads the four cell values surrounding each screen pixel and renders a terrain layer at that pixel only when it covers more than half of those four corners, producing automatically-rounded coastlines, grass/dirt edges, and other transitions with no pre-drawn edge, corner, or inner-corner art. The same four-corner read drives layered procedural detail (grass blades, foam, roads, footpaths, plowed fields, snow) and the entire ground renders in one draw call; demonstrated in the dev log for Valdrin, a 2D medieval kingdom-sim on Steam.

## What it does

A terrain-rendering technique that eliminates hand-drawn tileset art by moving all edge/corner logic from sprite art into a shader. The standard alternative — a "blob" autotile set — requires drawing a tile for every edge, corner, and inner-corner case for each pair of terrains, which combinatorially comes out to 47 distinct pieces per pair (reducible to around 16 or, with care, as few as 5, by reusing symmetric pieces); every added terrain type multiplies that work.

In this technique, each map cell holds nothing but a single integer terrain ID (water, sand, dirt, grass, etc.) — no sprite is chosen or stored per cell. A single shader does the rendering: for every screen pixel, it reads the four map cells surrounding that pixel's position and, for each terrain layer present among them, draws that layer at the pixel only if it covers more than half of the four corners. Because the visibility test is a simple majority-of-four-corners rule rather than a discrete lookup into pre-drawn art, transitions round themselves off automatically without needing a piece drawn for every possible corner combination. Adding low-frequency noise to the coverage test makes boundaries like coastlines read as naturally wandering rather than grid-aligned. The same four-corner read is reused to layer in procedural surface detail — individual grass blades overhanging dirt, foam washing at water edges, roads, footpaths, plowed fields, and snow — and the entire ground, across all terrain types and detail layers, renders in a single draw call.

This is a shader-only extension of the independently well-documented "dual-grid" autotiling principle: both approaches determine a render element's appearance from the four map cells touching it (2⁴ = 16 cases) rather than from eight neighbors of a single cell (47 cases), which is what makes diagonal/inner-corner cases resolve without special-casing. Standard dual-grid implementations still select from a small fixed set of pre-drawn tile sprites (15–16 pieces) via that four-corner bitmask; the technique in this item instead computes the coverage continuously in-shader with no sprite sheet or atlas lookup at all, so zero terrain-transition art is drawn by hand.

It was demonstrated in a dev-log reel for Valdrin, a 2D low-fantasy medieval kingdom/settlement sim by developer Stalwart Fox, available to wishlist on Steam (App ID 3929800); the reel's spoken audio names the game "Baldream," which does not match the caption's "Valdrin" or the Steam listing — likely a transcription error in the reel's own audio-to-text captioning rather than a second game.
