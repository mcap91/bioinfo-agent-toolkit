## What it says

Argues that dependence on closed LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic) is a business risk, citing GPT 5.6 Sol's release being restricted to US government-approved companies — the White House reviewing customer-by-customer access for the first two weeks before general availability.

Key claims:
- Open-source models (Qwen, Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek) are close to GPT-4 quality on most enterprise tasks; domain-specific fine-tuning closes the remaining gap
- GPU costs falling due to competition (Cerebras, Fireworks, Groq, SambaNova)
- The real moat is the data flywheel: every query, correction, and user feedback feeds the next fine-tuning round, creating compounding advantage competitors cannot copy

Reported case study (RAG company, self-reported, unverified): Qwen fine-tuned on domain data with negative-example dataset teaching "I don't know" responses. Hallucination rate 14% → under 2%. $15,600/month savings per 1M queries vs cloud APIs. Sub-2s responses with 60 concurrent users on one H100. Zero data leaving customer network. Hybrid deployment: local GPUs for base load, cloud GPUs for spikes.

## Key takeaways

- Model access is becoming a geopolitical/regulatory variable — closed-API-only architectures carry concentration risk
- Negative-example datasets (teaching the model to say "I don't know") are described as a practical technique for reducing hallucination in fine-tuned models
- Hybrid deployment (local GPUs for base load, cloud for spikes) balances cost and capacity
- Data flywheel creates compounding advantage difficult for competitors to replicate
