## What it does

NVIDIA Build is NVIDIA's platform for accessing and deploying AI models via API. It provides NIM (NVIDIA Inference Microservices) — optimized, containerized model endpoints for running LLMs, vision models, embedding models, and domain-specific models on NVIDIA GPUs. The platform offers both a hosted API playground (build.nvidia.com) for testing models and self-hosted NIM containers for on-premises or cloud deployment. The model catalog spans hundreds of models including Llama, Mistral, Qwen, and NVIDIA's own models, plus domain-specific models for healthcare, biology, and other verticals.

## Assessment

Note rather than watch because: (1) the platform is enterprise-focused with GPU-heavy deployment requirements (NIM containers assume NVIDIA GPU infrastructure), (2) the hosted API playground has free-tier rate limits that make it impractical for sustained agentic workflows, (3) for model API access OpenRouter already provides a more flexible multi-provider gateway in the catalog, and (4) the biological/scientific domain models on the platform (BioNeMo, etc.) could be individually cataloged if they become relevant to specific workflows. The NIM deployment pattern is worth noting for future on-premises model serving if GPU hardware becomes available.

## Mechanical details

- Hosted API at build.nvidia.com with OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- NIM containers for self-hosted deployment on NVIDIA GPUs
- Models organized by category: LLMs, VLMs, embedding, reranking, speech, biology, healthcare
- Free-tier API access for testing; enterprise licensing for production
- Container images pulled from NVIDIA NGC (NVIDIA GPU Cloud)
- Supports TensorRT-LLM optimization for NVIDIA hardware

## Security

- **License**: Mixed — platform itself is NVIDIA proprietary; individual models carry their own licenses (Apache-2.0, Llama Community, etc.)
- **Dependency health**: NIM containers are NVIDIA-maintained; NGC is a curated registry
- **Code quality signals**: Enterprise-grade platform from a major vendor; SLAs available for enterprise tier
- **Supply chain**: NVIDIA is a major public company; NGC containers are signed
- **Dangerous patterns**: None at the platform level; standard model deployment risks apply
- **Maintenance**: Actively maintained; models and containers updated regularly

## Usage notes

- Pair with the OpenRouter rankings (openrouter.ai/rankings) to scout open models, then pull/test them from this build catalog.
