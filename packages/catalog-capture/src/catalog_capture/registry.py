"""The one `SourceAdapter` registry and the one needs-link rewrite engine
(WK-0094 Phase B). A new source type is one new adapter registered here with
no edit to this module, `rendering.py`, `sources_writer.py`, or `cli.py`.

# DECISION: `adapters/` holds one module per source type (its needs-link URL
# rule, id parse, capture pipeline, and the sections it hands to the shared
# renderer/writer/review modules). `stages/` holds the shared capture-pipeline
# building blocks adapters call into (browser page capture, yt-dlp media
# fetch, audio decode+transcribe, keyframes+contact sheet, the multimodal
# read) — never copied per adapter. Top-level modules (`rendering.py`,
# `sources_writer.py`, `review.py`, `pricing.py`, this module) are the one
# shared format/engine every adapter feeds.

Registration is explicit and mutable (`register()`), not a hardcoded list —
`adapters/__init__.py` registers the two shipped adapters (Reddit, Instagram
reel) on import, and a test can register a throwaway adapter the same way
with no edit to this file (the extensibility claim, tested in
`test_adapter_extensibility.py`).
