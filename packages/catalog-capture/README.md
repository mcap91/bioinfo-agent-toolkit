# catalog-capture

Resolves `⚠ needs-link` lines in `catalog/inbox.md` into catalog-ready text, with no manual
copy-paste: Reddit `/s/` share links and Instagram reels today, through one `SourceAdapter`
registry (WK-0094 Phase B). Adding a source type is one new adapter — no edit to the shared
rewrite engine, block renderer, sources writer, or review module.

uv only — never base Python.

## Setup

```
cd packages/catalog-capture
uv sync --extra dev
```

Chromium must already be available to Playwright (shared download cache, or
`uv run playwright install chromium` if not) for the Reddit path.

## Module layout

- `registry.py` — the `SourceAdapter` protocol, the registry (`register`/`get_adapter`/
  `registered_adapters`), the one needs-link rewrite engine, and the shared `CaptureOutcome`
  shape every adapter returns. `# DECISION:` comment there records the `adapters/`/`stages/`
  split.
- `rendering.py` — the one inbox block renderer (`source:` line + adapter-supplied sections,
  fence-break defused once, no trailing newline).
- `sources_writer.py` — the one `catalog/sources/<platform>/<id>.md` writer (header lines +
  body + optional sibling artifact directory).
- `review.py` — the one review-sheet/index/tally module (replaces the reel-only
  `make_review.py`; never writes a verdict).
- `pricing.py` — LiteLLM price-table lookup, with a configurable path (CLI option and/or env
  var); a missing table always returns `(None, reason)`.
- `canonical.py`, `fence.py`, `versions.py` — small shared helpers (Reddit canonical-URL/post-id
  derivation, inbox fence-break defusal, tool-version strings).
- `cli.py` — `python -m catalog_capture capture|needs-link|review ...`.
- `adapters/` — one module per source type:
  - `reddit.py` — the `RedditAdapter` (needs-link URL rule, capture via `stages.browser`, block/
    sources sections).
  - `instagram_reel.py` — the `InstagramReelAdapter` (needs-link URL rule, the full
    probe→audio→transcribe→frames→read pipeline via `stages.*`, block/sources sections, OR-3's
    one-block-per-reel shape).
- `stages/` — shared capture-pipeline building blocks, called by adapters, never copied:
  - `browser.py` — headless-Chromium page capture with a per-site wait table (today: Reddit's
    `shreddit-post` poll).
  - `media.py` — yt-dlp anonymous probe + bestaudio/bestvideo download.
  - `transcribe.py` — ffmpeg decode to 16 kHz PCM + faster-whisper transcription.
  - `frames.py` — ffmpeg keyframe extraction + PIL contact sheet.
  - `read.py` — the multimodal `claude --print` read call: a prompt plus an ordered list of
    images (each with its own media type), stream-json in and out, usage parsing.

## Reddit

Engine: headless Playwright Chromium with a Chrome user agent (clears Reddit's JS challenge),
one capture module with a per-site wait table (`reddit.com` → poll for `shreddit-post`, soft — on
timeout it keeps the page text anyway). This is the WK-0054 ENGINE CHOICE ("own script"), copied
from `toolkit-workbench/web-capture/own/capture.py`. See `wiki/issues/WK-0054.md` and
`wiki/issues/WK-0080.md` ("Spec check — Reddit slice") for the evidence and rulings this package
follows.

## Instagram reels

Pipeline (WK-0079's recommended default stack, I4): yt-dlp `-j` anonymous caption probe →
yt-dlp bestaudio download → ffmpeg (imageio-ffmpeg, never a system ffmpeg) decode to 16 kHz mono
→ faster-whisper `small` CPU int8, VAD off → yt-dlp bestvideo download → ffmpeg keyframes
(`select='eq(n\,0)+gt(scene\,0.3)'`) + a PIL contact sheet → one Claude read (stream-json, no
tools, caption + transcript + sheet image) naming every tool/repo the reel shows plus any
on-screen text. Per OR-3 (operator ruling, 2026-10-26): the capture never verifies a URL or
decides what the reel is "about" — it hands the processing agent everything the read spotted,
labeled as unverified hints, and the agent decides what goes into the catalog. See
`wiki/issues/WK-0080.md` ("OR-3 Operator ruling: capture captures, the processing agent
decides") for the evidence and rulings.

Instagram carousels (`/p/` multi-image posts) are **not** captured by this package yet — a `/p/`
needs-link line stays `⚠ needs-link` until the carousel adapter lands (WK-0087). WK-0094 Phase A
probed all 12 known `/p/` links and committed two golden fixtures
(`tests/fixtures/instagram/carousel/`) for that adapter to build against.

## CLI

Capture one URL and print its inbox block (auto-detects the adapter from the URL, or pass
`--adapter`):

```
uv run python -m catalog_capture capture <url>
uv run python -m catalog_capture capture <url> --sources catalog/sources
```

Resolve every `⚠ needs-link` line any registered adapter owns, in an inbox file, in place:

```
uv run python -m catalog_capture needs-link --inbox catalog/inbox.md --sources catalog/sources
```

Options:
- `--limit N` — process at most N items across every adapter (useful for a dry run).
- `--delay SECONDS` — seconds between captures, sequential, not applied before the first item
  overall. Default: each matched line's own adapter delay (currently 3s for both Reddit and
  Instagram reels) — pass `--delay` to override every adapter's delay for this run.
- `--only NAME` — restrict the run to one registered adapter (`reddit` or `instagram_reel`),
  leaving every other adapter's lines untouched. This replaces the old separate
  `instagram-needs-link` command: run `--only instagram_reel` for the equivalent scope.
- `--prices-path PATH` — LiteLLM price table path for the Instagram read's USD estimate
  (default: the documented kb-checkout path, or the `CATALOG_CAPTURE_LITELLM_PRICES_PATH` env
  var). A missing table still yields `(None, reason)`, never a substitute rate.

Each matched line is replaced in place with a fenced block (`inbox.ts`'s existing `source:`-
prefixed `\`\`\`text` format), or left untouched if no adapter's rule matches it. A capture
failure becomes `⚠ capture-failed <url> — <error>` (never a silent drop); the Reddit adapter's
PDF-download event becomes `⚠ pdf <url>`. A line no adapter matches, but whose text mentions a
known platform (reddit.com, instagram.com), is reported on stdout as a near-miss worth a manual
check. Everything else in the inbox is left byte-identical. Exits non-zero (after printing a
summary) if any item failed.

**Retrying a `capture-failed` or `pdf` line.** `needs-link` only matches `⚠ needs-link <url>`
lines in a shape some adapter's rule recognizes. To retry, manually edit the line back to
`⚠ needs-link <url>` (drop the `capture-failed`/`pdf` reason and any trailing error text) before
running `needs-link` again — there is no automatic retry.

### Review sheets

Render one pre-filled review sheet per captured item (`catalog/sources/` → a sheet directory),
a `REVIEW.md` index with a suggested spot-check sample (capped at 5, WK-0094 OR-5), and tally
operator verdicts once they're filled in. This never writes a verdict — review is operator-owned
(WK-0079 OR-2: finder != verifier).

```
uv run python -m catalog_capture review build --sources catalog/sources --out <review dir>
uv run python -m catalog_capture review tally --out <review dir>
```

`review build` takes `--only NAME` (same as `needs-link`) to build sheets for one adapter only,
and `--sample-cap N` to override the default cap of 5.

## Concurrent edits

A full run can take several minutes (one capture per item, with a delay between them). The
inbox is read once at the start and written once at the end via a tmp file + atomic rename; if
the file's mtime or size changed on disk in between (someone edited it mid-run), the run
aborts without writing and reports which items it had already captured — their source files are
not lost, but the inbox lines for them are not updated, so run it again after resolving the
conflict.

## Tests

```
uv run pytest -v
```

The Reddit golden fixture (`tests/fixtures/JNjEe87YeN.txt`) is a real, unedited WK-0054
own-engine capture — not hand-written. The fence-break edge case is derived by mutating it.

The Instagram reel golden fixtures (`tests/fixtures/instagram/`) are the real golden reel
(`De5smNojeZm`) artifacts copied byte-for-byte from `toolkit-workbench/reel/outputs/De5smNojeZm/`
(`probe_ytdlp.json`, `transcript_small_cpu_int8.txt`, `sheet_t0.3.jpg`), plus this slice's own
real Claude read response (`read_response.jsonl`) captured against that exact sheet/transcript/
caption. The Instagram carousel golden fixtures
(`tests/fixtures/instagram/carousel/De9SalRGOhy/`, `.../DeCKnW0DAGc/`) are real, unedited
instaloader + yt-dlp probe captures (WK-0094 Phase A) for the carousel adapter (WK-0087) to build
against — this package does not yet read them.

`tests/test_output_snapshots.py` pins byte-exact output (rendered blocks, sources files, inbox
rewrites, and the Reddit CLI stdout/stderr) from before the WK-0094 Phase B refactor. Never
hand-edit a file under `tests/fixtures/snapshots/` — regenerate with `UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1` only
from code you've already verified is correct, then re-run without the env var to confirm the
snapshot is deterministic.
