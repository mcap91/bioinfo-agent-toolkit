## kb integration

This repository uses the `kb` toolkit (repo-local wiki, reviewed dispatch, deterministic graph). The kb
MCP servers (`kb-wiki`, `kb-dispatch`) are registered in this repo's `.mcp.json` and run from the kb
checkout; every kb tool call targets this repository via `dir`.

### Retrieval — do this before substantive work

Repository-context retrieval is a wiki/docs retrieval problem first, not a filesystem-search problem first.

1. Search the wiki with the kb wiki MCP `search` tool. This is the first retrieval step.
2. If you need a structured overview, regenerate views with the MCP `generate` tool and read them
   (`catalog`, `now`, `inbox`, `backlog`, `archive`).
3. Then read the relevant durable `docs/` pages.
4. Then check related `wiki/decisions/`, `wiki/issues/`, `wiki/initiatives/`, `wiki/areas/`, `wiki/sources/`.
5. Only then inspect implementation files.

If the kb wiki MCP server is not available this session, run the same steps via the kb CLI from the kb
checkout (`npm run wiki -- search --dir <this repo>`, `npm run wiki -- generate --dir <this repo>`). Do
not use raw `rg`, file globbing, or direct file reads as the first retrieval step — use the wiki MCP tools
(`search`, `generate`, `lint`), or the CLI fallback, first. Do not parallelize implementation search with
the initial retrieval pass.

### Operating rules

- Wiki: prefer the `kb-wiki` MCP tools (`search`, `generate`, `lint`, `create`, `allocate-id`,
  `build-search-index`, `sync-contract`, `bootstrap`); CLI fallback `npm run wiki -- … --dir <this repo>`.
- Dispatch: prefer the `kb-dispatch` MCP tools or the kb CLI.
- Graph: kb CLI (`npm run graph -- --dir <this repo>`).
- Always pass `dir` pointing at this repository; run kb from its own checkout, not this repo root.
- Do not create `HO-*` via `wiki create` — handoffs are dispatch-owned under `wiki/handoffs/`.
- If wiki records and code/tests disagree, report the mismatch rather than trusting a grep-first conclusion.

## Catalog pipeline

The catalog tracks external tools, skills, and frameworks. The full operator flow is in
`skills/catalog-intake/SKILL.md`. Quick reference:

1. **Intake:** pull links from Gmail or paste into `catalog/inbox.md`, then drain with the
   `drain` MCP tool. Unfetchable items (Instagram, Reddit `/s/` share links) stay in inbox
   marked `⚠ needs-link`.
2. **Processing:** run `npm run -w @catalog/mcp catalog:process` in the background. It processes
   every pending queue item headless and writes entries to `catalog/entries/`.
3. **After processing:** check `catalog/queue.json` for parked/errored items, commit new entries.

The MCP server provides 14 tools — see `CLAUDE.md` for the full list.
